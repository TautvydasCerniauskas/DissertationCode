      "Marshall: Um, everything here is dark and sketchy and seems illegal. It's like shopping in Barney's mind.\n",
      "Lily: Well, good luck, baby.\n",
      "Marshall: Bye. Hey, Barney, I'm not sure about this. A tailor in the back room of a pet store?\n",
      "Barney: Look, do you want a quality suit and a free rabbit or not? Ted, Sergei says stop moping around. You're distracting him from his process.\n",
      "Marshall: You speak Ukrainian?\n",
      "Ted: Guys, I'm kind of screwed here. I don't want to lose Victoria, but I can't ask her to stay just for me. And long distance definitely isn't an option.\n",
      "Marshall: No. No, no, no. No way. You know who likes long distance? Girls. It's all talking and no s*x. Kill me now.\n",
      "Barney: Don't knock long-distance relationships. I really think they can work.\n",
      "Ted: Really? You?\n",
      "Barney: Absolutely. I'm juggling four right now. There's Lisa in Madrid, there's Erica in Tokyo, there's Laura in Denmark, and Kelly on 34th Street. The lass thinks I'm a humble sheep shearer from Killarney.\n",
      "Marshall: Ted, do you remember in college when Lily did that summer art program in Paris?\n",
      "Ted: Yeah.\n",
      "Marshall: Well, she kept talking about this cheesy French guy, Gabriel. So, I went out to visit, and there was this party. And who shows up but Gabriel. And he's got this weak-ass, thin French moustache. I'm not much of a fighter, but I knew I could take this weird little dude. So, I took him aside, and I got all creepy quiet, I got the crazy eyes going, and I said, \"You stay away from Lily, or I swear to God I'll eat that moustache right off of your ugly French face.\" Yeah. Yeah, he literally ran away. I think he was crying. I never told Lily about it. To be honest, I'm not very proud of it. To be even more honest, I am.\n",
      "Ted: Um, other than confirming a lot of European stereotypes about Americans, did that little story have a point?\n",
      "Marshall: Yeah, the point is that even though Lily is my soul mate, long distance still almost killed us. If you think that there's any chance that Victoria is your soul mate, you should ask her to stay.\n",
      "Ted: Well, I don't know if she is. It's still so early, but yeah, she could be.\n",
      "Marshall: Oh, please. You barely know this girl. What's her favorite color? Is she a cat person or a dog person? Is she open to a three-way? Ted, I do more research than this before buying a cell phone. FYI, yes, I have three-way calling.\n",
      "Ted: Look, she can't be a cat person. I'm a dog person, I'm attracted to other dog people.\n",
      "Barney: Are you sure?\n",
      "Ted: All right. (He calls Victoria)\n",
      "Victoria: Hello.\n",
      "Ted: Hey, random question. How do you feel about cats?\n",
      "Victoria: Cats. Hated the musical, love the animal.\n",
      "Ted: Good to know. Um, okay. Good-bye. (He hungs up) She's a cat person. I don't know this girl at all.\n",
      "Barney: Oh, excellent. We'll take this one.\n",
      "Marshall: Whoa. Hey, hey, it's my suit. Shouldn't I be the one to choose?\n",
      "Barney: Here. Play with this pin cushion.\n",
      "Marshall: God. I'm going to look hot.\n",
      "Barney: Marshall, I can't let you waste a suit this nice fighting a losing battle for our planet's survival. This is a suit for winners. I am getting you an interview at my office. We need good men like you in our legal department. We get sued a lot.\n",
      "Marshall: No way. The Kid does not sell out.\n",
      "Barney: Oh, come on, dude! Three months working with me, you'll make more than Lily makes in a year.\n",
      "Marshall: No. I've made my decision.\n",
      "Ted: So have I. If I ask this girl to give up her dreams for me, and two weeks later, it's not working out, I'm, like, the biggest jerk of all time. It's just too much pressure on a new relationship. I'm going to tell her to go.\n",
      "In a restaurant\n",
      "Ted from 2030: And so I met her that night to tell her my decision.\n",
      "Victoria: All right, I've been thinking a lot about this... Okay, wait, before you say anything, I wanted to give you this. This is what happens when you, you know, let them finish baking.\n",
      "Ted: I want you to stay.\n",
      "At the Tailor / At the wedding shop\n",
      "Marshall: Everything here is dark and sketchy and seems illegal. It's like shopping in Barney's mind.\n",
      "Lily: Oh, good luck, baby.\n",
      "Marshall: Bye.\n",
      "Woman: Now, what sort of dress did you have in mind, dear?\n",
      "Lily: Nothing too huge or-or poofy. I'm not really a girlie girl. But I would like to look like a beautiful princess.\n",
      "Robin: I saw a couple up front that were nice.\n",
      "By the window? No offense, dear, but those are a little out of your price range.\n",
      "Lily: Where does she get off? She doesn't know how much money I make.\n",
      "Victoria: Oh, these women are experts. They can guess your net annual income just by looking at your underwear.\n",
      "Lily: Damn you Old Navy and your reasonably-priced three-packs!\n",
      "Victoria: At least we get free champagne!\n",
      "Robin: And cake.\n",
      "Victoria: Mm-hmm.\n",
      "Robin: Speaking of which, Victoria, have you decided what to do about your doughnut fellowship?\n",
      "Victoria: You know, I don't know. I mean, I want to go, but I don't want to lose Ted. I even thought about long distance, as if that ever works.\n",
      "Lily: Ugh. All talking and no s*x. Kill me now.\n",
      "Victoria: I know it sounds lame, but I actually think that Ted might be The One. That's pretty hard to walk away from.\n",
      "Robin: Well, I don't know. I'd feel a little Stepford turning down a huge opportunity to chase some guy I'd only known two months.\n",
      "Victoria: But this isn't just some guy. This is Ted. He's amazing. He's the best guy I know.\n",
      "Robin: Yeah, in America, but German guys? Whew! I would let them bread my schnitzel any day, if you know what I mean.\n",
      "Victoria: I really don't...\n",
      "Robin: s*x. Oh, excuse me, ma'am. This b*st*rd's kicked.\n",
      "Woman: Thanks.\n",
      "Victoria and Robin: Oh!\n",
      "Lily: It's okay, guys, I hate it.\n",
      "Victoria: Just horrible.\n",
      "Robin: It's bad, it's really bad. Short in front, long in the back? That is the mullet of wedding dresses.\n",
      "Lily: You know, Victoria, Marshall and I did long distance once. In college, I did an art course in Paris. I was the only American there. It was really lonely. I only had one friend, Gabrielle. She was kind of homely and strange-looking, and she was really self-conscious about this little moustache she had. Anyway, halfway through the semester, she just stopped talking to me, and I never figured out why. And then I had nobody. The only thing that got me through was knowing that my soul mate was back at home waiting for me. If Ted's your soul mate, then it may be worth it to hang onto him.\n",
      "Victoria: But how am I supposed to know if we're soul mates? It's too soon. Ooh. Speak of the devil. Hello.\n",
      "Ted: Hey, random question: how do you feel cats?\n",
      "Victoria: Cats. Hated the musical, love the animal.\n",
      "Robin: A cat person. Why am I not surprised?\n",
      "Victoria: Bye. Why does Ted want to know if I like cats?\n",
      "Lily: Maybe he's going to buy you one.\n",
      "Victoria: I did hear barking in the background. Maybe he was in a pet store. Does he want us to get a cat together?\n",
      "Robin: Maybe he's using an adorable kitty to guilt you into staying.\n",
      "Victoria: That is low. Do you really think that's what he's doing?\n",
      "Robin: Oh, I wouldn't even wait to find out. I would be on the next plane to Germany.\n",
      "Victoria and Robin: Aw.\n",
      "Lily: Oh, God, you guys are sucky liars.\n",
      "Robin: Ugly, ugly, ugly.\n",
      "Victoria: I don't know what to say. You know what? We're doing this all wrong. I am going to get you one of those front window dresses, just for fun.\n",
      "Lily: Are you okay?\n",
      "Robin: I'm fine.\n",
      "Lily: Okay. Just kind of seemed like you're trying to hustle Victoria out of the country.\n",
      "Robin: I'm not, I'm just trying to support her. She got a super-important dessert scholarship.\n",
      "Lily: Stop being sarcastic. It is a super-important dessert scholarship. Wow, that's hard to say without sounding sarcastic. Look... I know you're not Victoria's biggest fan, but she seems to make Ted happy. So think about that before you use your miles to buy her a plane ticket.\n",
      "Victoria: Somebody say \"beautiful princess.\"\n",
      "Lily: Oh, my gosh, it's perfect! Oh! This dress is totally going to get me laid on my wedding night.\n",
      "Victoria: Oh, look how happy she is. You know, I've always thought of myself as one of those independent women who would never let any guy mess with my career. And now I'm actually thinking about it. I feel guilty, like it's un-feminist or something.\n",
      "Robin: I know what you mean.\n",
      "Victoria: You do?\n",
      "Lily: Well, I'm always putting my career ahead of my relationships, and... to be honest, there's a lot of lonely nights in that job description.\n",
      "Victoria: See, that's what I'm afraid of.\n",
      "Robin: Choosing Ted over your career doesn't make you un-feminist. Maybe it just means that you guys would be happy together.\n",
      "Victoria: Robin... I think that you are the coolest. I'm so glad that we're friends.\n",
      "Robin: Oh, no way... you're the coolest.\n",
      "Victoria: No, you are.\n",
      "Robin: Okay, I am.\n",
      "Victoria: I'm going to stay.\n",
      "Victoria and Robin: Aw.\n",
      "Lily: Oh, I am so beautiful! Oh, don't tell me how much it costs. Just snap my neck now, so I can die this pretty.\n",
      "Robin: Wow, you look incredible.\n",
      "Lily: Oh. Okay, okay, how much is it, on a scale of never to never ever?\n",
      "Robin: Never ever, ever, ever, ever... times infinity.\n",
      "Lily: Well, it's okay. You know, what makes a bride beautiful is that she's just happy to be getting married. (She sits on the cake, without noticing it) Oh, guys, I know I look amazing, but the important thing is that Marshall and I love each other, right?\n",
      "Robin: Yes, you're right. But also... you just sat down in the cake.\n",
      "Victoria: But, you know what? It's going to come out because it's only... chocolate and raspberry.\n",
      "Robin: Okay. Come on, get up, let us see how bad it is.\n",
      "(Lily stands up and tears the dress apart, the woman arrives at the same time)\n",
      "Lily: It was like this when I found it?\n",
      "Woman: And how will you be paying for this?\n",
      "Lily: Credit card... s.\n",
      "In a restaurant\n",
      "Victoria: I wanted to give you... this. This is what happens when you... you know, let them finish baking.\n",
      "Ted: I want you to stay.\n",
      "Victoria: I have to go to Germany.\n",
      "Ted: You're going?\n",
      "Victoria: Yes. I have to.\n",
      "Ted: So that's what you decided?\n",
      "Victoria: Well, no... I mean, I actually came here tonight leaning toward staying, but when you just told me to stay, it made me realize that I have to go.\n",
      "Ted: What is this, opposite day or something?\n",
      "Victoria: No.\n",
      "Ted: So it is?\n",
      "Victoria: Ted, we've only been dating for two months. I can't let you make this decision for me.\n",
      "Ted: I was totally going to tell you to go, but then you gave me this cupcake, and it reminded me how great you are.\n",
      "Victoria: Well, is there any chance that you would move to Germany with me?\n",
      "Ted: Well, that's just crazy.\n",
      "Victoria: Oh, okay. So it's fine for me to make sacrifices for you, but for you it's crazy.\n",
      "Ted: But you have a job here and a life; I'd have nothing there.\n",
      "Victoria: You'd have me.\n",
      "Ted: We've only been dating two months. Oh, it's not fair. It's not fair that we have to break up. I hate this.\n",
      "Victoria: So... we're breaking up?\n",
      "Ted: I guess so. I guess so.\n",
      "At the appartment\n",
      "Marshall: God, that sucks, man. I'm so sorry.\n",
      "Ted: It was just too much pressure too soon. I mean, maybe it was silly to even think... Yes, Marshall, I see your new suit, and it's awesome.\n",
      "Marshall: Well, thank you for acknowledging it. It was weird that you hadn't. Look, I understand that you guys had to break up eventually, but why today?\n",
      "Ted: She's leaving tomorrow.\n",
      "Marshall: Yeah, but she's still in town.\n",
      "Ted: Yeah, she... she's still in town.\n",
      "Marshall: Yeah, so you spend one more amazing day together. Ted, think about it this way: if you knew that you were going to lose your leg tomorrow, would you sit on the couch and cry about it, or would you run, and jump, and do some awesome air kicks while you still could?\n",
      "Ted: Awesome air kicks, huh?\n",
      "Marshall: New pajama bottoms?\n",
      "Ted: You know it.\n",
      "The Bar\n",
      "Ted: So we can sit around and cry, or we can run, and do awesome air kicks before our leg gets chopped off.\n",
      "Victoria: Wait, so we're sharing the leg?\n",
      "Ted: No, the leg is a metaphor.\n",
      "Victoria: How could the leg be well enough to do awesome air kicks one day, and yet still so sick it needs to be chopped off the next? I don't know, Ted.\n",
      "Ted: Come on, we've had a good run. Why end on a fight?\n",
      "Victoria: Well, what would you want to do?\n",
      "Ted: Let's do all the stuff we talked about doing and never got around to.\n",
      "Victoria: Like go to the Mets.\n",
      "Ted: Yeah, we'll walk across the Brooklyn Bridge.\n",
      "Victoria: See some monkeys at the zoo?\n",
      "Ted: Go to that French-Vietnamese place we keep passing and say we want to try?\n",
      "Victoria: Wow! We better get going.\n",
      "Ted: Yeah, big day.\n",
      "Victoria: Yeah.\n",

      "Robin: Lily, you have to tell him. That dress cost a fortune.\n",
      "Lily: No, I'm just gonna wait for the next time Marshall really screws up, and then, I'll just slip this in, and it won't seem so bad by comparison.\n",
      "Robin: Well, here's hoping he cheats on you.\n",
      "Lily: Yeah, but only, like, second base.\n",
      "Barney: Look at us: two guys in suits. You feel that slight tingle? That's every girl in the bar wanting you, and every guy wanting to be you. Actually, it's mostly me, but you're getting some of the splash.\n",
      "Marshall: Hey, babe. Dollar beer night, so I splurged and got us each our own.\n",
      "Barney: So, have you thought more about coming to work for Barney Corp?\n",
      "Marshall: Oh, please... your company is not called Barney Corp.\n",
      "Barney: Yet. Oh, I almost forgot. Sergei sent me your bill.\n",
      "Marshall: B... Barney, this says $4,000. I thought you said that it was one-third price.\n",
      "Barney: Yeah, must be a $12,000 suit. Oh, well, guess you'll have to come work at my company.\n",
      "Marshall: You set this up! You set this whole thing up!\n",
      "Barney: I most certainly did...\n",
      "Marshall: Well, it won't work. Even if I have to get two extra night jobs, I'll pay your precious tailor. I'm not selling my soul. Baby, I know that this will make things harder, but I will make it work, I promise.\n",
      "Lily: I destroyed an $8,000 wedding dress.\n",
      "Marshall: What time is the interview?\n",
      "Barney: 9:00 a.m., and you'll need new shoes. Don't worry, I know a guy.\n",
      "At the airport\n",

      "Victoria: Okay.\n",
      "Ted: Look, I know it never works for anyone, but... do you want to try long distance?\n",
      "Victoria: Yes. Yes!\n",
      "Ted: We can beat the odds.\n",
      "Victoria: Odds, schmodds.\n",
      "Ted: It's gonna work. We're going to make it work-- it'll work.\n",
      "Ted from 2030: It didn't work. Long-distance was and is a terrible idea, a really terrible idea, just awful. But more on that later.\n",

It was written by an anthropologist named Dr. Aurelia Birnholz-Vazquez, it told the story of the year she spent living among the Western Lowland Gorillas of Cameroon. When Dr. Birnholz-Vazquez came to the local community college to give a lecture, Marshall, the youngest member of the audience, raised his hand with a question.\n",

      "Marshall: You never had a four-way.\n",

      "Ted: Yes, I do. You got me. That is exactly what I want right now. And so what? I want this. She wants this. It's happening, and if you have a problem with it, don't be in Germany. It's been nice pretending to talk to you. Thanks for not calling me and good night.\n",

      "Barney: Much obliged. 57 days?! Ted, you are in a slump.\n",
      "Ted: No, it's not a slump. It's an intentional hiatus from girls. A slump is when you strike out every time you step up to the plate. But I'm off the roster, baby. I'm in the locker room sitting in the whirlpool. And I'll tell you something, it feels pretty good.\n",
      "Barney: Yeah, you know what else is in that locker room? A naked dudes hanging brain. Ted, you need a lady. And I've got the next best thing-- Mary. She lives in my building. She's smart, she's hot, she's totally cool.\n",

      "Lily: No, not really. We just chitchatted and I borrowed her lipstick. Why is Vampire Lou the host of a Saturday Afternoon Kung Fu Movie? You know, it just makes no sense. God, that pisses me off.\n",
      "Ted: Lily, you okay?\n",
      "Lily: Oh, yeah, I'm just tired. And when I get tired, I get cranky.\n",
      "Sandy: Really? I couldn't imagine you cranky.\n",
      "Lily: \"Really? I couldn't imagine you cranky.\"\n",
      "Mary: Wow. Why are you so tired?\n",
      "Lily: Well, I teach kindergarten and the school board took away my nap time, the kids' nap time.\n",
      "Barney: Lily, quit your job. Work at a private school. You won't have to deal with the school board, and you'll make a ton more money.\n",
      "Lily: Well, guess what, Barney? I don't base all my life decisions on how much money I'm going to make, unlike you and, sadly, my fiance.\n",
      "Marshall: Well, it's just an internship, for the record.\n",
      "Lily: Yeah, because if I did sacrifice all my values just for an easy buck, what would that make me?\n",
      "Mary: A prostitute.\n",
      "Lily: Exactly. Thank you, Mary.\n",
      "Robin: So, Mary, what do you do for a living?\n",
      "Barney: She's a paralegal.\n",
      "Mary: Yes, I'm a paralegal.\n",
      "Robin: Oh, so, Mary the paralegal. What does a paralegal do exactly?\n",
      "Mary: I just assist with day-to-day clerical work in a law firm downtown.\n",
      "Lily: Oh, what firm?\n",
      "Mary: Douglas, O'Halloran and Stamp.\n",
      "Marshall: That's a real law firm.\n",
      "Mary: I know.\n",
      "Marshall: Nice.\n",
      "Ted: You're pretty good on your feet.\n",
      "Mary: Are you flirting with me?\n",
      "Ted: Is that allowed?\n",
      "Mary: Yes, it's encouraged.\n",
      "Ted: You know, I wouldn't normally say this on a first date, but... well, considering... I'm just going to say it. You are so hot!\n",
      "Mary: Well, thank you.\n",
      "Ted: You're welcome.\n",
      "Robin: Mary, Ted is a great guy. You hold on to him. Don't let him out of your sight for a minute.\n",
      "Ted: So, Sandy, what do you do? Oh, wait, I know what you do. You're the guy who reads the paper in the morning.\n",
      "Sandy: You got me. What do you do, Ted?\n",
      "Ted: Oh, same thing as you-- I read the paper every morning. But then after that, I finish my coffee and I go to my real job as an architect where I make an actual contribution to the world. I'm just kidding. Love your show. You're terrific.\n",
      "Sandy: Thanks. I never tire of hearing that.\n",
      "Mary: Hey, you know that scene in Empire where they lower the helmet onto Darth Vader's head? Do you think that's how Sandy puts his hair on in the morning?\n",
      "Ted: You just insulted someone I hate by referencing something I love. Damn, you just got even hotter.\n",
      "Ted from 2030: And so, as the night wore on, I started to realize, this girl, despite what she did for a living, was kind of great.\n",
      "Ted: Hey.\n",
      "Robin: Hey. Mary seems nice. Have you kissed her yet, or are you waiting until you're in a serious relationship with someone else?\n",
      "Ted: I, uh... I wanted to apologize for everything that happened.\n",
      "Robin: And just like that, it's all okay. Roll credits.\n",
      "Ted: So you're going to be mad at me forever? What, we're not even friends now?\n",
      "Robin: We're still friends.\n",
      "Ted: Are we? You don't return my calls, we never hang out and now you're trying to make my jealous by waving Edward R. Moron in my face?\n",
      "Robin: Oh, and Paralegally Blonde isn't here in her low-cut dress to make me jealous?\n",
      "Ted: Oh, so now she's a whore?\n",
      "Robin: What?\n",
      "Ted: You know something? Mary the paralegal is awesome. And you know what else? I didn't come here tonight to make you jealous, I came here to support you as a friend. And frankly, I'm sick of trying.\n",
      "Sandy: I like that guy.\n",
      "Ted: Hey.\n",
      "Sandy: Hey. What were you guys talking about over there?\n",
      "Ted: Oh, I was, uh, just telling my friend that I think you're awesome.\n",
      "Sandy: Well, thanks. You know, this is one of the nicer hotels I've ever been in.\n",
      "Ted: Oh, yeah, my friend did the remodel. You should see the rooms. The views are amazing.\n",
      "Mary: Yeah? Maybe it's too bad we don't have a room.\n",
      "Barney: Room 1506. My treat. You kids go nuts. Actually, don't use the mini-bar. Do it. Come on, Ted, do it. This is one of those things you have to do before you turn 30.\n",
      "Ted: Sleep with a prostitute?\n",
      "Barney: No, lose your virginity. What up. Statistic-- men who have had at least one relationship with a prostitute are 75% more likely to have success in future relationships.\n",
      "Marshall: You just made that up.\n",
      "Barney: Withdrawn.\n",
      "Marshall: Lawyered. Okay, three things. First of all, Robin's category's almost up. And second of all, you cannot do this. It's wrong on every level. And third, I've been placing small items in Sandy's hair all night. He still hasn't noticed.\n",
      "Ted: I know I can't do this. I'm not doing this. It's just... it's a shame. She's really cool.\n",
      "Marshall: Yeah, well... there we go.\n",
      "Vampire Lou: Scooter \"Bam-Bam\" Branson for A Bicycle-- Joyride or Deathtrap? Mike Murphy for 13, Pregnant and Addicted. And Robin Scherbotsky for Pickles, the Singing Dog. And the winner is... Robin Scherbotsky.\n",
      "Robin: Thanks. Oh, wow. This is really a surprise. Um, you know it's nice to be able to share this award with my friends. They're all here tonight. Marshall, Lily, Sandy Rivers... Barney... And that's it. Those are all my friends. Thank you.\n",
      "Marshall: Congratulations.\n",
      "Robin: Oh, thanks. Um, Sandy, do you want to get a cab?\n",
      "Sandy: Sure. Let's go.\n",
      "Ted: Yeah, this party's dead. Mary, you want to go upstairs? We, uh, got a room.\n",
      "Marshall: Dude, what are you doing?\n",
      "Ted: What's it look like?\n",
      "Marshall: It looks bad, is what it looks like. You cannot do this.\n",
      "Ted: Marshall, she is a really cool girl when you get to know her. Besides, I'm trying to make Robin jealous.\n",
      "Marshall: Oh, that's real mature.\n",
      "Lily: Marshall, what is up with you and Ted?\n",
      "Marshall: Nothing, baby. Don't worry about it. Fine. Do what you want. Hey.\n",
      "Mary: Should we go?\n",
      "Ted: Yeah. Thanks. Well... Good night.\n",
      "Robin: Good night.\n",

      "Marshall: Wow, so they're...? Robin, where's Sandy Rivers?\n",
      "Robin: I put him in a cab.\n",
      "Barney: So you and he aren't...?\n",
      "Robin: I don't date people I work with. I was just trying to make Ted jealous. Is he...?\n",
      "Marshall: He's off trying to make you jealous.\n",
      "Robin: Oh, well, good for them. And, you know, if Ted likes her, she's probably pretty cool.\n",
      "Marshall: Lily, I know you're asleep, but I have to tell someone this, and we tell each other everything. So, here it goes. Mary's not a paralegal. She's a prostitute.\n",
      "Lily, waking up: Mary's a prostitute?\n",
      "Robin: What?!\n",
      "Marshall: Barney paid for her.\n",
      "Lily: Is that true?\n",
      "Marshall: We were having a conversation about prostitution, and then Barney calls her up and then she shows up at the bar and now she and Ted are upstairs.\n",
      "Robin: Okay, seriously, what is going on with Ted lately? Is he having a nervous breakdown?\n",
      "Lily: You know, Barney, for anyone else, this would be a new low, but sadly, for you, it's just a new middle. Oh, my God, I used her lipstick! Ah!\n",
      "Marshall: That's her napkin.\n",
      "Lily: No!\n",
      "Barney: Okay, well, I guess now is as good a time as any. In keeping with tonight's award show motif, I'd like to announce this evening's big twist ending! Vampire Lou, would you do the honors?\n",
      "Vampire Lou: \"Mary's not really a prostitute.\"\n",
      "Marshall: What?\n",
      "Barney: That's all, Vampire Lou. Nicely done.\n",
      "Marshall: So she's not...?\n",
      "Barney: No. Mary's just a paralegal who lives in my building. Oh-- ha-ha! And here's the best part-- she has no idea that Ted thinks she's a hooker. Oh, come on. If you don't laugh, it just seems mean.\n",
      "In the hall of the hotel\n",
      "Ted: I feel kind of like Richard Gere.\n",
      "Mary: Not shy about your looks, are you?\n",
      "Ted: No. You know, Mary, I've never done this before.\n",
      "Mary: Done what?\n",
      "Ted: You know, been... on a \"date.\"\n",
      "Mary: Yeah, right. Wait, you're kidding, right?\n",
      "Ted: No. Why, is that so odd?\n",
      "Mary: Well, Ted, I mean, I've been going on dates since I was 15.\n",
      "Ted: God, you were just a kid. Well, look, let's just have a few drinks. We'll relax and...\n",
      "Mary: Yeah, that sounds great. I had clients riding me all day long.\n",
      "Ted: Must be tough.\n",
      "Mary: Yeah. I mean, this one guy just wouldn't leave me alone. I mean, talk about a**l. Well, here we are.\n",
      "Ted: Okay, look, Mary, I like you a lot. I'm sort of amazed at how much I like you, but I can't do this. You're a hooker.\n",
      "Mary: What?\n",
      "Ted: Look, maybe I'm old-fashioned, but I'm sorry, that's a deal-breaker for me. I'm not going to have s*x with a prostitute.\n",
      "Mary: No... Ted, I'm a paralegal.\n",
      "Ted: Come on, Mary, there's no one else around. You're a hooker.\n",
      "Mary: No, Ted... I'm a paralegal.\n",

      "Marshall: Not funny, dude.\n",
      "Barney: I know, it was hilarious.\n",
      "Ted: Why would you do that?\n",
      "Barney: I did it to prove a point.\n",
      "Ted: What point?\n",
      "Barney: Stay with me. It's going to come to me. No. Ah, okay, here's the point. You thought that Mary was a sure thing, right? So what happened? She took you up to a hotel room on the first date. All you have to do is be that confident with every girl you meet and your slump is over.\n",
      "Ted: So the message is, I should treat every woman like a whore?\n",
      "Barney: Come on, dude, you should be thanking me.\n",
      "Ted: She slapped me and stormed off.\n",
      "Barney: Can you blame her? You called her a hooker.\n",
      "Marshall: I'm sorry, dude, it was funny.\n",
      "Ted: Yeah. Well, it's getting late. I should get back to my room.\n",
      "Barney: Your room?\n",
      "Ted: Yeah, that really expensive hotel room you put on your credit card-- never checked out. By the way, you know what's super fun? Pouring Dom Perignon down a bathtub drain. Well, it's almost 3:00. Got a massage. Toodles.\n",
      "(Ted leaves)\n",
      "Marshall: Come on, if you don't laugh, it just seems mean.\n",

      "Marshall: There was a cancellation two months from now.\n",
      "Lily: You want to have our wedding in two months? No. It's impossible.\n",

      "Lily: No, there's just not enough time. There's no way... Oh! Mini-vomit.\n",
      "Marshall: Okay, look, look, look. I know that it's sudden, but check it. If we don't take this, guess who's on their way with a deposit check.\n",
      "Lily: Todd and Valerie?\n",
      "(An other couple is running)\n",
      "Ted from 2030: When you're planning a wedding, there's always one couple with similar taste that seems to be one step ahead of you. Todd and Valerie were that couple.\n",

      "Marshall: The 88. They're this awesome band. They played my law review party. They were found guilty. On three counts of rocking.\n",

      "Lily: He wouldn't have understood. He's not exactly nervous about tying the knot. So I spent my nights reading, painting, setting the high score on Super Bomber Man...\n",
      "Ted: That was you? Awesome!\n",

      "Ted: Let me guess. It's somewhere far away.\n",
      "Lily: San Francisco. But it's not like I'm going to do it. The dates conflict with the wedding. But I love painting, and I've always wondered if I'm any good. This was a way to find out. And the interview is tonight. In New Haven.\n",
      "Ted: You don't want to get married.\n",

      "Ted: Lily, we live in the center of art and culture in America. I'm sure you could find a program here that's just as selective. But you chose one in a city 3,000 miles away, and you didn't tell Marshall. I think it's pretty clear what that means.\n",
      "Lily: Okay, I was... I was having second thoughts. But I'm not any more. I... I mean, this flat tire was a sign. I'm not supposed to do this. I'm supposed to go home and-and be with Marshall. You must think I'm so stupid.\n",
      "Ted: I don't think you're stupid.\n",
      "Lily: I love Marshall.\n",

      "Lily: Ted, let's go to New Haven.\n",
      "Ted: Lily, don't do this to yourself.\n",
      "Lily: I just need to know if I can get in. If I do this interview, and get into the program, then I'll know, and I can forget all about it, and get married. Come on! It's an adventure.\n",
      "Ted: No, it's not an adventure. It's a mistake.\n",
      "Lily: Okay, yes, it's a mistake. I know it's a mistake. But there are certain things in life where you know it's a mistake but you don't really know it's a mistake because the only way to really know it's a mistake is to make the mistake, and look back, and say, \"Yep. That was a mistake.\" So, really, the bigger mistake would be to not make the mistake, because then you go your whole life not really knowing if something is a mistake or not. And, damn it, I've made no mistakes! I've done all of this-- my life, my relationship, my career-- mistake-free. Does any of this make sense to you?\n",
      "Ted: I don't know. You said \"mistake\" a lot. Lily, don't do this.\n",

      "Ted: Forgive you for what? (Lily leaves with he car) Lily. Lily! Hey, Lily, this is Ted, the guy you left stranded by the side of the road. I just wanted to say good luck with the interview, remember to pick up some milk... Oh, and, when I get home, I'm going to kill you. And, also, I texted you the same thing.

      "Ted: Oh, for the waiting room of your dental practice? Highlights is a children's magazine.\n",
      "Robin: Yeah, I got it. I thought it might look cool. Of course my colorist took \"highlights\" to mean, \"I want to look like a tiger,\" hence the hat.\n",

      "Robin: No way.\n",
      "Ted: Please. I bet it doesn't look that bad. I bet it looks grr-eat!\n",

      "Ted: Kind of amazingly. Uh, she's 28, like me.\n",

      "Veterinary: Oh, that's so sweet.\n",
      "Robin: Okay, yes, it's sweet in theory, but isn't it also kind of crazy? I mean, a string quartet in my living room... who does that?\n",
      "Veterinary: Nobody does that.\n",
      "Robin: Exactly.\n",
      "Veterinary: No, honey... nobody does that. But I guess I'm just a hopeless romantic. I'm gonna put my hand up your dog now.\n",

      "Lily: Yeah, but there's a lot of things I've always wanted, and I haven't done any of them. I'm sorry. I just need to do this before settling down forever.\n",
      "Marshall: So now we've gone from \"I was never gonna do it\" to \"I need to do this\"? Did I leave the room at some point? When did that happen?\n",
      "Lily: Oh, maybe when you said you wouldn't let me do it.\n",
      "Marshall: I never said that! You know, if you're having these kind of doubts now, what's gonna change in three months? Maybe we just shouldn't get married at all.\n",
      "Lily: Maybe not.\n",

      "Lily: Marshall...\n",
      "Marshall: 'Cause if you can't promise me that, we shoul just break up right now. I'm not gonna wait around for three months just to have my heart ripped out.\n",

But while I'd been off having one of the best nights of my life, your Uncle Marshall had been having one of the worst nights of his (Ted finds Marshall on their stairs, holding in his hand Lily's engagement ring).\n",

(DAY ONE, Ted and Robin are in bed after they had s*x) For one thing, you spend most of the time in bed (Marshall is in his bed groaning // DAY EIGHT, Ted and Robin are at MacLaren's with Barney, kissing and laughing. Barney seems to kill himself, miming a gun in his mouth) Your friends can't stand to listen to you (DAY SIXTEEN, Barney is with Marshall who is crying and says \"It was a really beautiful song\". Barney mimes a rope around his neck). And you never seems to wear pants. (DAY TWENTY-TWO, at the apartment, Robin is going to the bathroom only wearing a T-shirt while Marshall is wallowing on the couch in underpants. Ted, in underpants too, comes out of his room).\n",

      "Barney: You know what Marshall needs to do? He needs to stop being sad. When I get sad, I stop being sad and be awesome instead. True story.\n",
      "Ted: It's only been a month. He just needs to goat his own pace. Anyway, lily is the one who caused this whole mess.\n",
      "Robin: Hey, cut her some slack! She's our friend too. She's just trying to figure out who she is.\n",

      "George Clinton: I am so glad you agreed to play tennis with me.\n",
      "Lily: Oh you know, Marshall tried to get me to play tennis for nine years but I didn't do it because I never truly loved him.\n",
      "George Clinton: I got you a gift.\n",
      "Lily: Oh! A ferret. I'll buy it some food next door at the Pet Palace. I've always wanted one, but Marshall have this secret phobia of ferrets.\n",

      "Ted: Exactly!\n",

You are the miserable, whining, shampoo-sniffing ghost of Marshall and frankly, a guy like you doesn't have a shot in hell with a girl like Lily. You know who might have a shot somewhere down the line? Marshall. The real Marshall. But if you go down there now like this, you'll blow it for him and he's never gonna forgive you. Of course, whatever I say, you just will do the opposite so, have a great weekend, good luck screwing up your life. Come on, Robin... Is it still OK if we borrow the car?\n",

      "Ted: Oh, but it's OK to hand him a 9 mm? Yeah. He told me. So you're a gun nut?\n",

      "Ted: So Lily is not back in town and she doesn't have a boyfriend. That's good news, right?\n",
      "Marshall: Yeah. I don't know. Those credit card charges were the only remaining connection I had to her. I don't know where she is or what she's doing. She was my whole life man and now she's... She's gone.\n",
      "Ted: You know, first day at college, I showed up, I was so freaked out and I got up to my room and there was my roommate, lying on the bed with his feet up on the wall. He had headphones on, a big smile on his face like he just didn't give a crap. Happy. Confident. Not afraid of anything. That guy was you. You before you met Lily.\n",

      "Ted: Yeah.\n",
      "Marshall: I was high that day. I was. I was so high I thought you were the dean.\n",
      "Ted: What I'm saying is, there's a version of you without Lily and... It's not this. You can't let Lily stole your identity the way that guy stole hers.\n",

      "Ted from 2030: It took him 67 days and one really disgusting batch of pancakes, but Marshall had come back from the dead. Because while baseball, strippers and guns can help, the only thing that can really heal a broken heart is time.\n",
      "Ted from 2030: Marshall and Lily have together for nine wonderful years until she dumped him and ran off to San Francisco. The healing process was taking a long time. Then, one night he made a giant leap forward.\n",

      "Barney: Of course, it is. What do you think \"identical\" means? \"Ident-\" - same. \"-ical\" - person. Same person. Hey, we could double date.\n",
      "Marshall: Fine.\n",
      "Barney: Ah!\n",
      "Marshall: But you have to promise me you're not gonna steal my new twin and leave me with your old, used-up twin.\n",
      "Barney: Used-up? They're a human being Marshall.\n",
      "Ted from 2030: So Uncle Marshall and Uncle Barney went out on a double date with the twins.\n",
      "Barney: How are you doing?\n",
      "Marshall: Great. Amazing. This is so much fun. Me and the girl are really cliking.\n",
      "Barney: You are. You definitely are. Listen, you're gonna have to leave now. I just talked with the twins and, get this, I'm going home with both of them! Yeah. That's happening.\n",
      "Marshall: It is impossible that you're doing this to me again.\n",
      "Barney: But they're twins.\n",
      "Marshall: You said to me that being single would be like being in a candy store.\n",
      "Barney: Well, it's not like a candy store. It's a lawless, post-apocalyptic wasteland. I may be your best friend...\n",
      "Marshall: Ted's my best friend.\n",
      "Barney:...but in this world it's every hombre for himself. That's what being single is. And after nine years of captivity, that is the single greatest lesson I can teach you about surviving in the wild. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have two unique breasts an two duplicates waiting for me. (Barney rejoins the twins, Marshall leaves the bar). Oh bad news. Marshall got food poisoning.\n",
      "Twin 1: What?\n",
      "Twin 2: That's so bad. I really liked him.\n",
      "Barney: Yeah. I guess we're just a threesome tonight.\n",
      "Outside of MacLaren's, Marshall runs into Lily.\n",
      "Marshall: Lily. What are you doing here?\n",
      "Lily: Oh, I-I was just walking by. I wasn't... Oh, you mean, New-York? My program ended. It was just great. Just lots of fun. It was awful. It was the worst mistake I ever made. I'm so sorry Marshall. And, hello.\n",
      "Marshall: Lily, this was the worst summer of my life.\n",
      "Lily: I know. It was the worst summer of my life.\n",
      "Marshall: It was the hardest thing I've ever had to go through.\n",
      "Lily: Can we please get back together?\n",
      "Marshall: All that crap you said to me about \"we need to figure out who we are outside of us, and we need to learn to do things on our own.\". It broke my heart. Three months ago, you broke my heart.\n",
      "Lily: Can we please get back together?\n",
      "Marshall: Lily, you were right. All that crap was right. So, no. No, we can't get back together. We shouldn't. At least, not right now.\n",
      "Lily: Wow. OK. Yeah. Wi... Will we still see each other?\n",
      "Marshall: Yeah. Yeah. I think so. I don't know. This is all really new to me. I just got out of a long relationship. I like your hair.\n",
      "Lily: Thanks. I, uh, figured, new city, new color - uh, old color. (Music 'It's gonna be different this time' / Later). And the pizza there. Worst pizza ever! I'm so glad to be back in New-York.\n",
      "Marshall: Yeah.\n",
      "Lily: Listen, if there is anything I can do to even begin to make things up to you.\n",
      "Marshall: Actually, there's maybe something you can do for me. But you can never ever ask me why.\n",
      "In MacLaren's, Barney is still with the twins.\n",
      "Barney: So then, I was promoted to assistant ménage-er. Manager. Why do I keep doing that? (Lily arrives.) Lily?\n",
      "Lily: You gave me Chlamydia, you jerk! (She throws a drink at his face and leaves)\n",
      "Barney: So, where was I? Ah yes. Assistant ménage-er. I did it again. I can't believe it!\n",
      "(Lily shows up again)\n",

      "Ted: Kids you know that photo in the den? It was taken back in 2006, when Grandma and Grandpa came to visit me and we all went out to brunch. We all look pretty happy, right? Wrong.\n",
      "Year 2006\n",
      "Lily: I wish your face would melt off.\n",
      "Marshall: I wish your eyeballs would explode.\n",
      "Lily: I hate you.\n",

      "Ted's mother: Robin...! (She lifts her arm and hits the waitress who falls down.)\n",
      "Ted from 2030: Okay, for any of this to make sense, you got to understand, there are three parts to this story. Let's start with the Marshall and Lily part.\n",
      "The Marshall and Lily part.\n",
      "The previous day, at the apartment.Ted from 2030: As a 30th anniversary gift, I had flown my parents to New York for the weekend.\n",
      "Ted's mother: Oh, I forgot to tell you, your cousin Jimmy had a wonderful time at that spa he visited.\n",
      "Ted: You mean the spa the judge ordered him to go to to quit cocaine?\n",
      "Ted's mother: Coffee?\n",
      "Ted from 2030: You know, Grandma and Grandpa didn't like to talk about things that were uncomfortable, emotional, or in any way... real.\n",
      "Lily: Hi, Mr. and Mrs. Mosby.\n",
      "Ted's father: Oh, Lily! Hi, Marshall.\n",
      "Marshall: Good to see you.\n",
      "Lily: I was just stopping by to pick up some of my things.\n",
      "Ted's mother: Yes, we were so sorry to hear about your... You know, the, the... Well...\n",
      "Marshall: Lily calling off the wedding and dumping me?\n",
      "Lily: Me begging Marshall to take me back and him rejecting me?\n",
      "Ted's mother: I love your hair.\n",
      "OPENING\n",
      "Ted from 2030: This was only the second time Marshall and Lily had seen each other since breaking up, but to their credit, it wasn't that awkward.\n",
      "Marshall: Actually, we're cool. We just divided up CDs. It was all very civil. I'm proud of us. Wwe're, we're good.\n",
      "Ted's mother: Well, we were all going to go to Casa a Pezzi at 8:00. Lily, would you like to join us?\n",
      "Lily (looking at Marshall): Um...\n",
      "Marshall: What?\n",
      "Lily: Well, I-I don't want to go if it would make you uncomfortable.\n",
      "Marshall: Why would it?\n",
      "Lily: Well, I mean, yeah, we're... We're good, but you got to admit there's that stuff between us.\n",
      "Marshall: Um, not for me. Now it's just like we're friends. It's like we're brother and sister.\n",
      "Lily: \"Brother and sister\"?! Okay. Fine, yeah, I'll see you at the restaurant, bro. (She leaves)\n",
      "Ted from 2030: See? Not awkward at all.\n",
      "The evening, at \"Casa a Pezzi\". Lily arrives.\n",
      "Lily: Hello, everyone.\n",
      "All: Hi.\n",
      "Lily: Hello, Marshall.\n",
      "Ted's mother: Lily, that is a stunning dress.\n",
      "Lily: Oh, thanks. It's kind of revealing, but I thought, \"Hey, we're all family.\" Right, bro? Ooh, ah...\n",
      "Ted: What's wrong?\n",
      "Lily: Oh, I, I hurt my ankle in yoga today. The instructor told me to just take deep breaths to get through the pain, just... (She breathes deeply while Marshall glances at her low neckline) Are you all right? You're kind of sweating.\n",
      "Marshall: No, I'm fine. It's just... This roll is really spicy.\n",
      "The next morning, at the apartment.\n",
      "Marshall: Lily is evil! She just wore that dress to torture me. Well, you know what? Two can play at that game. See, at brunch, I'm going to torture Lily right back. Yeah. There's a part of my body that she's got a weakness for, too.\n",
      "Barney: Dude, you can't whip that out at brunch.\n",
      "Marshall: No, not that. I'm going to unleash my calves.\n",
      "Barney: That's crazy. Nobody's turned on by men's calves. They're a thoroughly unerotic body part.\n",
      "Marshall: Well, yeah, I'd say that, too, if I had those skinny little chicken legs.\n",
      "Barney: I'll be waiting by the phone for your apology.\n",
      "At brunch.\n",
      "Ted from 2030: So Marshall showed up at brunch with a plan.\n",
      "Marshall: Hello.\n",
      "Ted's father: Oh, hi.\n",
      "Ted: Hey, Marshall.\n",
      "Robin: Hey.\n",
      "Lily: Hey. How are you feeling? You looked kind of feverish last night.\n",
      "Marshall: Oh, no, I actually feel great. It is kind of warm in here, though, isn't it?\n",
      "Lily: Oh, I don't know, if anything, it's kind of... (Marshall starts unzipping his knee zips) What are you doing?\n",
      "Marshall: Oh, nothing. Nothing at all. I'm just making myself feel a little bit more... comfortable. (He starts massaging his calve) Oh. Oh, yes. I've been doing all these toe lifts lately, and so... My calves have really been cramping up.\n",
      "Marshall and Lily are in the restaurant bathroom.\n",
      "Marshall: Take off your dress.\n",
      "Lily: Take off the rest of your pants.\n",
      "Later, leaving the bathroom and joining the table.\n",
      "Lily: I really wasn't expecting that to happen.\n",
      "Marshall: Yeah, me neither. It kind of complicates things, doesn't it?\n",
      "Lily: Yeah, it does. Why did you have to throw your magnificent calves at me? You know you have a punter's leg.\n",
      "Marshall: Well, why did you have to throw your beautiful boobs at me? You know you have... boobs.\n",
      "Lily: Just admit it, you came here trying to seduce me.\n",
      "Marshall: Seduce you? You seduced me.\n",
      "Lily: You sat down next to me and took most of your pants off.\n",
      "Marshall: You went to San Francisco for three months.\n",
      "Lily: How is that seducing you?\n",
      "Marshall: Well, it's not but I'm still mad about it.\n",
      "Lily: All right, that's it - I want The Beatles Anthology.\n",
      "Marshall: Oh, well, that's too bad. I'm keeping it! And you know the U2 box set I gave you? Look inside - all Dave Matthews.\n",
      "Lily: You are evil.\n",
      "The waitress (taking a photo): Smile!\n",
      "Ted: I'm going to kill him.\n",
      "Barney: I can't say I blame you.\n",
      "Ted: No, I mean I'm seriously going to kill him.\n",
      "Ted from 2030: Now let's talk about the Barney part of the story.\n",
      "The Barney part.\n",
      "The previous day, at the apartment.Ted from 2030: This was going to be Robin's first time meeting my parents, so we were both a little nervous.\n",
      "(Somebody knocks at the door. Ted opens. It's Barney.)\n",
      "Ted: Barney, what are you doing here?\n",
      "Barney: Uh... I'm here to meet your parents. They must be dying to meet me after all the legendary Barney stories you've told them.\n",
      "Ted: I haven't told them any legendary Barney stories.\n",
      "Barney: What?\n",
      "Ted: Barney, here is a list of all the things I talk with my dad about: baseball.\n",
      "Barney: But I'm your best friend.\n",
      "Ted: Well, actually Marshall's my...\n",
      "Barney: I'm the most important person in your life.\n",
      "Ted: Well, Robin's actually...\n",
      "Barney: How could your parents not know about me? I'm delightful.\n",
      "Robin: To us, sure, in very small, infrequent doses. I mean, come on, you're not exactly the kind of friend parents want their kid to have.\n",
      "Barney: Oh, really? Then I guess those shoes aren't the thing you're most wrong about today.\n",
      "(Knock at the door, Ted opens.)\n",
      "Ted: Hey, Mom. Hey, Dad.\n",
      "Ted's father: Ted.\n",
      "Ted: I know you've all been excited to meet...\n",
      "Barney: Barney Stinson. An honor to meet the two of you. That needlepoint \"Bless This Mess\" pillow you made for Ted - what a stitch. Stitch! Did that just happen? (Ted's parents and Barney laugh)\n",
      "Ted: Uh, Mom, Dad, this is my girlfriend, Robin.\n",
      "Ted's father: Hello.\n",
      "Robin: Hello.\n",

      "Ted's father: A real looker.\n",
      "Robin: That's funny, I didn't even \"look\" in the mirror today. That's not anything, is it? So, I made a reservation at San Marino tonight for 8:00.\n",
      "Barney (laughing): San Marino! Oh, you're serious? Yikes. No. We have to try Casa A Pezzi. Best salmon risotto I have ever had.\n",
      "Ted's mother: I love salmon risotto.\n",
      "Barney: I know.\n",
      "Robin: How are we supposed to get a table at Casa A Pezzi? They're booked for weeks.\n",
      "Barney: Well, lucky for you, I happen to know the head waitress, which is ironic because...\n",
      "Ted: Stop it! Don't, don't!\n",
      "Barney: Ironic because we both work at a homeless shelter where I serve the food. Where do you volunteer, Robin?\n",
      "In the kitchen.\n",
      "Robin: What's the matter with you? I'm his girlfriend, and I'm not even trying that hard. Way to wreck the curve, kiss-ass.\n",
      "Barney: Robin, I'm his best friend. That's a commitment. Girlfriend? That's like a bad flu. Out of your system after a couple weeks in bed. High five!\n",
      "(Ted's mother comes in the kitchen)\n",
      "Ted's mother: Can I help?\n",
      "Barney: Yes, you can, Virginia. There's a story behind that broach, and I'm going to hear it.\n",
      "Ted's mother: Well, funny you should ask...\n",
      "At \"Casa a pezzi\". Barney is playing the piano.Ted's father: Whoa! Bravo, Barney. Oh, oh oh!\n",
      "Ted's mother: That is my all-time favorite sonata.Barney, you are just delightful.\n",
      "Barney: No, Virginia, you're delightful, I am deligh-ted. And he's just Ted. I'm really not planning these things; they just keep happening.\n",
      "Lily: Whoops. I think I dropped an ice cube down here. Ow, it's so cold.\n",
      "Marshall: All right, that's it, I'm out of here. In a minute.\n",
      "Barney: Anyone up for a drink at MacLaren's?\n",

      "Lily: Me, too.\n",
      "Ted: Yeah, I'm sure my folks are gonna want...\n",
      "Ted's father: I feel like I could knock back a few cervezas.\n",
      "Ted: Cervezas? Did he fall?\n",
      "Ted's mother: I'd join you, too, but I want to get up early for Mass tomorrow.\n",
      "Barney: St. Peter's, 8:45 a.m., it's my favorite service.\n",

      "Ted: Do you know that when you make up a statistic, you always use \"83%\"?\n",
      "Barney: You think I'm lying. Well, have you done any surveys on the subject? Because the good people at  m http://www.swingers.open-marriage-is-na ... lygamy.org m  have, and they beg to differ.\n",

      "Barney: Okay, let's take a look. Oh, yeah, it's a cougar all right. A prime specimen. See, you can identify a cougar by a few key characteristics. Start with the hair. The cougar keeps up with current hairstyles as a form of camouflage. The prey may not realize that he's engaged a cougar until he's already being dragged, helpless, back to her lair. Now, the blouse. The cougar displays maximum cleavage possible to captivate her prey. If you're watching them bounce, she's about to pounce. See the claws? Long and sharp, to ward off rival females... Or open alimony checks. Yeah, this one's a beaut. Okay, let the hunt begin.\n",

      "Lily: Ted, you should pitch your building to Druthers.\n",
      "Ted: Are you kidding? He's Hammond Druthers. He's a legend. I'm just part of his team. This building is huge for the firm, so it's really important we don't blow it. (Giggles) All right, enough!\n",

      "Ted: Too green?\n",

      "Lily: Okay, I may have exaggerated that last one, but the point is, he was mean. And that's why I took away his ball.\n",
      "Ted: What does his ball have to do with anything?\n",
      "Lily: Druthers has to be taught he can't behave like that. When I was teaching kindergarten,whenever a kid was mean, I would take away one of his toys. The kid would be upset at first,but then he'd learn to stop being mean.\n",
      "Robin: Hey, guys. What's going on?\n",
      "Ted: Lily stole my boss' baseball signed three times by Pete Rose.\n",
      "Robin: Why? Was he being mean?\n",
      "Ted: You know about this?\n",
      "Robin: Yeah. It's her own personal form of justice. Did you tell him about that time at the Gap?\n",
      "Lily: Oh, that was a good one. This sales guy was rude to Robin, so I took a pair of khakis.\n",
      "Robin: I gave them to you for your birthday.\n",
      "Ted: So I've been walking around in stolen khakis?\n",
      "Lily: I prefer to call them \"justice khakis.\"\n",
      "Ted: That's not justice. It's shoplifting,and it's a crime.\n",
      "Lily: So is being mean.\n",
      "Ted: Lily, your little system doesn't even make sense. In kindergarten, the kid knew why he was being punished. Druthers just thinks someone stole his ball.\n",
      "Lily: Well, that's why I left a note.\n",
      "Ted: A note?\n",
      "Lily: Yeah. When he finds it, he'll understand why his ball was taken away, he'll stop being mean, and the office will be a nicer place to work. Maybe he'll even be open to hearing your ideas.\n",
      "Ted: Look, Lil, we're all tolerating this prolonged nervous breakdown you're clearly having, with the punk band and the beekeeping and the petty larceny, but this is my career you're messing with.\n",

And, if the thief doesn't believe me, well, then you are gambling more than Pete Rose - major league baseball's all-time hit leader, a man whose absence from the hall of fame is a travesty to the entire sports world - ever \"allegedly\" did!\n",
      "Lily: Wow. Looks like bye-bye, iPod.\n",
      "Ted: Give him his ball back right now. People are going to get fired.\n",

      "Mr Druthers: Excellent. Bring them in.\n",
      "Ted from 2030: Our client was a major bank and financial services company in Spokane. They wanted a modern skyscraper that still captured the distinct flavor and history of the northwest.\n",
      "Mr Druthers: Ladies and gentlemen, I give you the Spokane national bank building.\n",
      "Client: That's a pen1s!\n",
      "Mr Druthers: That's... that's ridiculous. There's no way this majestic tower can be confused with the male organ of love.\n",
      "Client: We're not building a pen1s. You got any other ideas?\n",
      "Mr Druthers: Other ideas? You said you wanted Hammond Druthers. This is Hammond Druthers.\n",

      "Lily: Oh. You know what, Ted? That was very nice. You have earned these screws back. Don't sit in your desk chair until you've put them back in.\n",

      "Barney: B-plus?! Marshall, after I've gone through my eight weeks of physical therapy, I am going to get you that \"A\"!\n",
      "Marshall: Let her go. She belongs out there in the wild. You should feel proud. You fought the cougar and lived.\n",
      "Ted from 2030: Kids, when you reach your late twenty, you might be surpise to discover you still don't have life quite figured out. Like with aunt Lily. Even though she was back from San Francisco, she was still on a quest to find herself.\n",
      "Robin's apartment.\n",
      "Lily: It's just that all I've ever done is teach kindergarten. I want to get out there and change the world. I want to find my passion.\n",
      "Ted from 2030: And she did find it.\n",
      "Lily (coming in Robin's): I'm going to be a life coach.\n",
      "Ted from 2030: In fact, she found it again and again.\n",
      "Lily: I'm going to be a marine biologist... Slam poet... Beekeeper! Not a beekeeper.\n",

      "Lily: What do you want?\n",
      "Ted: I don't think that's how you're supposed to greet a customer at Big Wave Luau.\n",
      "Lily: Aloha, island visitors. The big wave brought you to our humble luau. For that, we thank you. Or in my native tongue, mahalo.\n",
      "Barney: I didn't catch your name. Did you guys catch her name?\n",
      "Ted: No.\n",
      "Lily: My name is Anuhea. It means cool and fragrant,much like any of our 12 specialty drinks.\n",
      "Ted: Robin, nothing to add?\n",
      "Robin: No. Lily is my friend and I'm not going to make fun of her for trying to follow her dreams.\n",

      "Marshall: Yeah, well, it was supposed to be, but my professor's like the toughest grader I've ever seen. She had like a bad divorce this summer and now she's taking it out on us. To tell you the truth, I think she just needs to get laid.\n",
      "Barney: Really? Laid, you say?\n",
      "Marshall: You wouldn't be into her.She's, like, in her late 40s.\n",
      "Barney: She hot?\n",
      "Marshall: Yeah, I guess she's kind of hot, yeah.\n",
      "Barney: And she's looking for some action. Sounds to me like she could be a cougar.\n",
      "Robin: A what?\n",
      "Barney: A cougar. An older woman, usually in her 40s or 50s, single and on the prowl for a younger man.\n",
      "Ted: What's a woman in her 60s or 70s? A turtle?\n",
      "Barney: Marshall, I've thought it over and I accept your challenge.\n",
      "Marshall: I didn't challenge you to have s*x with...\n",
      "Barney: Tomorrow, the cougar hunt begins.\n",
      "Lily (arriving): So, I quit my job. I just couldn't take it anymore. Approximately 50 times a day, some guy asks me for a lei...\n",
      "Marshall: Classic.\n",
      "Robin: Ted, didn't you tell me they need a new assistant in your office?\n",
      "Ted: Yeah. Somebody did just quit.\n",
      "[FLASHBACK. Ted's office]\n",
      "Ted: So, where should we eat today? (looking at the assistant with a whole chicken in a container) Oh awesome, you brought lunch for everyone? (the girl leaves, crying)\n",
      "[END OF FLASHBACK]\n",
      "Marshall: Dude, that is cold-blooded.\n",
      "Ted: It was an honest mistake. Look, when somebody opens up a container with an entire chicken in it, it's okay to assume they made lunch for everyone.\n",
      "Robin: Ted, that girl didn't quit. You destroyed her.\n",
      "Ted: It was an whole chicken. And did I mention she had 12 sides?\n",
      "Barney: Oh, now you're gonna bash her figure. Real classy, Ted.\n",
      "Ted: So, Lily, what do you say? Do you want the job?\n",
      "Lily: What would I be doing?\n",
      "Ted: Basically, you're sort of a general office assistant.\n",
      "Ted's office.\n",
      "Ted: You'll sit there. My station is right over here. And things are a little bit crazy right now 'cause we're pitching a new building to a big client.\n",
      "Lily: Oh, right, is that the...?\n",
      "Ted: Yeah. Here's the model.\n",
      "Lily: You weren't kidding. It really does look like a giant pen1s.\n",
      "Ted: I know. For whatever reason, Mr. Druthers just doesn't see it.\n",
      "Lily: How can he not see it? I mean there's the...\n",
      "Ted: I know.\n",
      "Lily: And the way it...\n",
      "Ted: I know.\n",
      "Lily: And the two little...\n",
      "Ted: I know.\n",
      "Lily: It is just...\n",
      "Mr Druthers (arriving): Spectacular? Why, thank you.\n",
      "Ted: Lily, this is Mr. Druthers, the head architect on the project. Lily's going to be our new office assistant.\n",
      "Mr Druthers: Ah.\n",
      "Lily: Nice to meet you.\n",
      "Mr Druthers: Isn't it? Ted, I looked at your design for the penthouse balcony. Tell me, do you want to be an architect?\n",
      "Ted: I, uh... I am an architect.\n",
      "Mr Druthers: Really? Well, my six-year-old nephew plays with legos. Is he an architect?\n",
      "Ted: Well, not unless he somehow passed all his licensing exams.\n",
      "Mr Druthers: Ted, you've got promise. But you have to study what I do more carefully. Now I want you to design some styrofoam trees for the building model. Think you can handle that?\n",
      "Ted: Absolutely.\n",
      "Mr Druthers: So you're going to design the...\n",
      "Ted: Styrofoam trees.\n",
      "Mr Druthers: Once again, with feeling.\n",
      "Ted: Styrofoam trees.\n",
      "Mr Druthers: Styrofoam trees!\n",
      "Ted: Styrofoam trees!\n",
      "Mr Druthers: That's the spirit. Now, gather 'round. This isn't just about trees, Ted. This is about life. And sometimes in life, you have to get the trees just right or you're fired, hmm? (He leaves)\n",
      "Lily: Man, that guy is a total, well... (gestures to the building model)\n",
      "Marshall's law school.\n",
      "Marshall: Okay, wait, wait, wait. That's professor Lewis's office there.\n",
      "Barney: Okay, let's take a look. Oh, yeah, it's a cougar all right. A prime specimen. See, you can identify a cougar by a few key characteristics. Start with the hair. The cougar keeps up with current hairstyles as a form of camouflage. The prey may not realize that he's engaged a cougar until he's already being dragged, helpless, back to her lair. Now, the blouse. The cougar displays maximum cleavage possible to captivate her prey. If you're watching them bounce, she's about to pounce. See the claws? Long and sharp, to ward off rival females... Or open alimony checks. Yeah, this one's a beaut. Okay, let the hunt begin.\n",
      "Marshall: Wait, wait, wait.I'm not so sure I'm comfortable with you hunting my constitutional law professor.\n",
      "Barney: Who do you rather have grading your papers: a savage, man-eating jungle cat, or a purring, satisfied kitty?\n",
      "Marshall: Go, Barney. Go mount and stuff that cougar.\n",
      "Barney (stepping into the office, speaking with an Italian accent): Scusi, I am Luigi, italian exchange student. I was, uh, walking to class, but then I noticed you... Bella principessa...\n",
      "Pr Lewis: Tell me what you want or get out.\n",
      "Barney: Direct. I like that. The name's Barney. What I want... is you.\n",
      "Pr Lewis: Turn around. My place. Two hours. Don't be tardy.\n",
      "MacLaren's.\n",
      "Lily: I can't believe how Mr. Druthers treats people. And that building? Talk about overcompensating.\n",
      "Ted: He's not usually this bad. It's just that the partners have made it very clear this project is make or break for us, so lately he's been a little testy. (The girls giggle) You know what I mean: crotchety. (Giggles) I'm just saying it's been hard on him. (More giggles). All right stop.\n",
      "Robin: Did you show lily your design?\n",
      "Ted: No.\n",
      "Lily: What design?\n",
      "Ted: It's nothing.\n",
      "Robin: It's fantastic. Just for fun, Ted's been working on his own design. And it doesn't look at all like male genitalia. At least, not healthy male genitalia.\n",
      "Lily: Ted, you should pitch your building to Druthers.\n",
      "Ted: Are you kidding? He's Hammond Druthers. He's a legend. I'm just part of his team. This building is huge for the firm, so it's really important we don't blow it. (Giggles) All right, enough!\n",
      "Pr Lewis' apartment.\n",
      "Barney: Oh, my god. Incredible.\n",
      "Pr Lewis: Hmm... C minus.\n",
      "Barney: C minus? What are you talking about? I just pulled an all-nighter!\n",
      "Pr Lewis: You didn't budget your time well, you glossed over some of the most important points, and your oral presentation was sloppy and inconclusive.\n",
      "Ted's office.\n",
      "Lily: Mr. Druthers asked if you were making the trees or waiting for them to sprout on their own. Then he stared at me until I laughed.\n",
      "Ted: Okay, I'm done.\n",
      "Lily: Great. I'll put the paints away. You just go show him.\n",
      "Ted: Great. Thanks.\n",
      "Mr Druthers: Well, finally. I wondered whether you were making the trees or waiting for them to sprout on their own.\n",
      "Ted: Good one, sir. Anyway, here they are.\n",
      "Mr Druthers: Too green.\n",
      "Ted: Too green?\n",
      "Mr Druthers: Yes, the leaves should really be more of a natural brown color. Almost brunette. And think bushier. I want this tower to rise from a thicket of wild, ungroomed, brunette shrubbery. Can you picture it, Ted?\n",
      "Ted: I can't un-picture it.\n",
      "Mr Druthers: Good. Oh, my God! It's gone!\n",
      "Ted: What? What's gone?\n",
      "Mr Druthers: My baseball signed three times by Pete Rose.\n",
      "Ted: Well, it's got to be around here somewhere.\n",
      "Mr Druthers: What do you think, Ted, it just let itself out of its plastic case and rolled away? Somebody stole it.\n",
      "Ted: Well, um, I better get back to these styrofoam trees.\n",
      "Mr Druthers: Oh, who cares about the trees? It's just busy work to make you feel like you're contributing.\n",
      "Ted: Inspiring as always, sir. Lily? Where's she put those paints? (Ted opens one of Lily's desk drawers and find the ball)\n",
      "MacLaren's.\n",
      "Lily: Hey.\n",
      "Ted: Hey. Um, Lily, question for you. Why did I find Mr. Druthers' baseball signed three times by Pete Rose in your desk drawer?\n",
      "Lily: That's easy. I took it.\n",
      "Ted: Why?\n",
      "Lily: It's simple.\n",
      "[FLASHBACK]Mr Druthers: I can't believe there's no horseradish for the roast beef. I guess you were sick the day they taught that at sandwich university\n",
      "Mr Druthers: Mother, no one from the nursing home is stealing from you. I didn't get you a birthday present.\n",
      "Mr Druthers (to a kid): What? You gonna cry? Huh? Little crybaby's going to cry? Hey, everybody, look! The little crybaby's gonna cry! I lost my ice cream!\n",
      "[END OF FLASHBACK]\n",
      "Lily: Okay, I may have exaggerated that last one, but the point is, he was mean. And that's why I took away his ball.\n",
      "Ted: What does his ball have to do with anything?\n",
      "Lily: Druthers has to be taught he can't behave like that. When I was teaching kindergarten,whenever a kid was mean, I would take away one of his toys. The kid would be upset at first,but then he'd learn to stop being mean.\n",
      "Robin: Hey, guys. What's going on?\n",
      "Ted: Lily stole my boss' baseball signed three times by Pete Rose.\n",
      "Robin: Why? Was he being mean?\n",
      "Ted: You know about this?\n",
      "Robin: Yeah. It's her own personal form of justice. Did you tell him about that time at the Gap?\n",
      "Lily: Oh, that was a good one. This sales guy was rude to Robin, so I took a pair of khakis.\n",
      "Robin: I gave them to you for your birthday.\n",
      "Ted: So I've been walking around in stolen khakis?\n",
      "Lily: I prefer to call them \"justice khakis.\"\n",
      "Ted: That's not justice. It's shoplifting,and it's a crime.\n",
      "Lily: So is being mean.\n",
      "Ted: Lily, your little system doesn't even make sense. In kindergarten, the kid knew why he was being punished. Druthers just thinks someone stole his ball.\n",
      "Lily: Well, that's why I left a note.\n",
      "Ted: A note?\n",
      "Lily: Yeah. When he finds it, he'll understand why his ball was taken away, he'll stop being mean, and the office will be a nicer place to work. Maybe he'll even be open to hearing your ideas.\n",
      "Ted: Look, Lil, we're all tolerating this prolonged nervous breakdown you're clearly having, with the punk band and the beekeeping and the petty larceny, but this is my career you're messing with.\n",
      "Lily: I'm not sure I like your tone. You know what? Now you just lost the ball.\n",
      "At the apartment.\n",
      "Marshall: I'd ask you how last night went, but we had a pop quiz today. Nobody got higher than a c-minus.\n",
      "Barney: I know, I know.\n",
      "Marshall: You claim to have so much s*x. I only assumed you'd be good at it.\n",
      "Barney: Look, I miscalculated. I thought she'd be old and fragile, like most cougars. But kitty's got claws. Don't worry though. Tonight, I'm seeing her again.\n",
      "Marshall: Just let it go, man. You're making things worse.\n",
      "Barney: I promise you, after tonight, that cougar will be my pet, and I its master.\n",

      "Barney: I think I'm falling in love with you.\n",
      "Pr Lewis: Oh, God. That wasn't your first time, was it? Although that would explain a lot.\n",
      "Barney: What? No.We had s*x yesterday.\n",
      "Pr Lewis: Oh, right. That. Well, you had s*x yesterday. I revised my syllabus for the spring semester.\n",
      "Ted's office.\n",
      "Ted: When Druthers goes to get his bagel, I'll go in, grab the note, put the ball back. If something goes wrong, yell out, \"who wants espresso?\" So I'll know he's coming. Got it? Okay, now give me the ball.\n",
      "Lily: No.\n",
      "Ted: What do you mean, no?\n",
      "Lily: I mean I stand by what I did, Ted.\n",

In fact, I overheard your iPod talking, and he may shuffle off at any minute.\" Normally, I would scream at everyone until my voice goes, but maybe that's the wrong reaction here.\n",
      "Lily: Interesting.\n",
      "Mr Druthers: Instead, I'm giving my baseball until the end of the day to decide he's homesick, or, tomorrow morning, I'll begin firing three people an hour. And, if the thief doesn't believe me, well, then you are gambling more than Pete Rose - major league baseball's all-time hit leader, a man whose absence from the hall of fame is a travesty to the entire sports world - ever \"allegedly\" did!\n",
      "Lily: Wow. Looks like bye-bye, iPod.\n",
      "Ted: Give him his ball back right now. People are going to get fired.\n",
      "Lily: No, they're not. It's just a tantrum, Ted. I saw this in kindergarten all the time.\n",
      "Ted: This isn't kindergarten. Mr Druthers is an adult, and he wants his ball back.\n",
      "Lily: All right, I'll give it back if you show him your plans.\n",
      "Ted: No. You'll give it back or you're fired.\n",
      "Lily: I'm sorry, Ted. I just can't do that.\n",

      "Pr Lewis: No, he's not fine.\n",
      "Marshall: Professor Lewis, hi.\n",
      "Pr Lewis: Mr. Eriksen. Hello. I graded your paper tonight. I was pleasantly surprised.\n",
      "Barney: Yeah, she was.\n",
      "Pr Lewis: B plus.\n",
      "Barney: B-plus?! Marshall, after I've gone through my eight weeks of physical therapy, I am going to get you that \"A\"!\n",
      "Marshall: Let her go. She belongs out there in the wild. You should feel proud. You fought the cougar and lived.\n",

      "Lily: Oh, my God. These pancakes are delicious!\n",
      "Marshall: Yes! Thank you. Uhm, I learned how to cook while you were gone this summer.\n",
      "Lily: Oh. Do you want to cook dinner tonight?\n",
      "Marshall: Yeah, sure. How about pancakes?\n",
      "Ted from 2030: And things were back to normal... Almost.\n",
      "Lily: You may not have much range, but at least I'm marrying a guy who knows how to make pancakes.\n",
      "Marshall: Oh, uhm...\n",
      "Lily: I mean, uhm... Well, I... I realize that we haven't really discussed whether us getting back together means us getting married, but... I still wanna. Do you still wanna?\n",
      "Marshall: Really?\n",
      "Lily: Of course, I love you.\n",
      "Marshall: No, I mean, that's how you're gonna do it? \"Do you still wanna?\" That's like the lamest proposal ever. When I did it, I got down on my knees... I don't know, I'm just saying.\n",
      "Lily (getting down on one knee): Marshall Eriksen, will you ma...\n",
      "Marshall: No, no, no, no, no, no.\n",
      "Lily: What?!\n",
      "Marshall: You can't lead with that. You got to... build up to that. You got to have, like, a little speech.\n",
      "Lily: Do you remember your proposal to me? (She puts her hand on her eye)\n",
      "Marshall: I had a speech prepared.\n",
      "Lily: What do you want to hear?\n",
      "Marshall: I don't know. I mean, you could tell me, like, about how good-looking and funny and smart I am and I've been working out lately. It might be nice for you to mention something about that.\n",
      "Lily: Marshall... You are good-looking...\n",
      "Marshall: Thank you.\n",
      "Lily: Funny...\n",
      "Marshall: Oh, thanks.\n",
      "Lily: Smart...\n",
      "Marshall: And a few tears wouldn't hurt.\n",
      "Lily: Okay, would you freakin' marry me already?\n",
      "Marshall: I'll marry you. Of course. But, uhm, until you see a ring on this finger, don't expect me to put out.\n",

      "[FLASHBACK]Marshall (on the phone): Yeah, so now she's gone and the wedding's off. What do you call someone who just takes off and leaves like that? What do you call that? I think that that's a little strong. I can't even believe you would use a word like that. Geez, Grandma.\n",

      "Lily: Ted, for the rest of our lives, we are going to be telling the amazing story of how we went to Atlantic City and got married. Don't you want to be in that story?\n",

      "Lily: Oh, Robin, that's a really cute outfit.\n",

      "Lily: I'm going to get the bouquet. You guys get the veil. We'll meet in the chapel in 20 minutes. Ready? Break. (She leaves)\n",

      "Marshall: No, we got to go get the veil.\n",

      "Marshall: Yeah, okay.\n",
      "Barney: No, you guys go ahead. I'm going to find the veil. (He leaves)\n",
      "Ted: So this is it, right? The last 20 minutes of your single life. I'm proud of you, buddy.\n",

      "Marshall: Oh, yeah, definitely.\n",
      "Barney: Okay, I got the veil. She wasn't ready to be married. All right, let's talk bachelor party. Are we thinking full-on strip club, or should we rent a room and have a private toy show?\n",
      "Ted: What did you just say?\n",
      "Marshall: Barney, no.\n",
      "Barney: Marshall, I'm your best man.\n",

      "Barney: And as your best man, I have to throw you a bachelor party. That's part of being a best friend.\n",
      "Marshall: You're not my best friend.\n",
      "Ted: Right here.\n",
      "Marshall: Barney, I don't have any time for a bachelor party. I've got, like, 18 minutes.\n",
      "Ted: 18 minutes...\n",
      "18 minutes later.\n",
      "Lily: Oh, good. Did you get the veil?\n",
      "Barney: Of course.\n",
      "Marshall: And it took us exactly 18 minutes. We went to a strip club.\n",
      "Ted: Dude!\n",
      "Barney: Unbelievable!\n",
      "Marshall: We weren't there for very long. It's not like I had time to have a lap dance or anything. I got a lap dance.\n",
      "Lily: Your last lap dance ever.\n",
      "Marshall: Right. What?\n",
      "Robin (arriving, wearing a \"shirt boobs\"): Okay, I'm here. Right?\n",
      "Ted: Oh, God, the things people waste money on in Atlantic City.\n",
      "Robin: Does it smell like strippers in here?\n",
      "Ted: That's weird, right? Marshall and Lily are getting married!\n",
      "Lily: Hell, yeah, look at this. (She turns on her musical bouquet, playing the Wedding March)\n",
      "Marshall: Oh, baby, this is it. Let's do this thing.\n",
      "Lily: Hi. We're here to get married.\n",
      "Woman: Congratulations. We offer a variety of packages to give you the special day you've always dreamed about.\n",
      "Marshall: We don't want any of that. Just your basic quickie wedding will be fine.\n",
      "Woman: Yeah. You know this isn't Vegas, right?\n",
      "Robin: Well, sure. In Vegas, the casinos pump in oxygen. Here, it looks like everyone brought their own.\n",
      "Ted (looking at Robin's shirt): What?\n",
      "Woman: It also takes three days to get a marriage license in New Jersey. The earliest I could book you for is Monday.\n",
      "Lily: No, no, no, it has to be today. That's the whole point.\n",
      "Woman: Look, I don't know what to say, but if you guys don't want to book a wedding for Monday or play a round of keno, I can't help you. Thirty-five.\n",
      "Ted: Wait, I don't understand, people get married in Atlantic City all the time.\n",
      "Woman: Yes, they do, but they don't elope. They choose Atlantic City for its white sand beaches, world-class amenities, and exotic Riviera feel.\n",
      "Lily: Have you been outside?\n",
      "Ted: There is half an orca whale rotting not 20 feet from the cabana.\n",
      "Marshall: You guys, take it easy, guys. Are you sure about this?\n",
      "Woman: About the marriage laws of the state where I work in a wedding chapel? Yeah, I'm pretty sure.\n",
      "Barney: Bright side: the bachelor party continues!\n",
      "Ted: Yes! Continues? You mean \"start.\" He means \"start.\" We went to a strip club.\n",
      "Woman: Twenty-seven.\n",
      "Lily: Is there any way that we could get a license today?\n",
      "Woman: You could go to the courthouse. In some extreme circumstances, the waiting period can be waived, but you have to have a good reason.\n",
      "Lily: Well, we're in love.\n",
      "Marshall: What better reason could there be?\n",
      "Woman: The last one I heard was, \"I'm going to Iraq tomorrow to defend my country,\" but, you know, give yours a whirl.\n",
      "Ted from 2030: So we went to the courthouse.\n",
      "Courthouse.\n",
      "Marshall: God, this is taking forever.\n",
      "Robin (to Ted): Can't believe they're getting married.\n",
      "Ted: I know. I am so proud of these two. After all they've been through. In fact, that crazy road has led them all the way here to Atlantic City...\n",
      "Robin: Ted, up here.\n",
      "Ted: Uhm?\n",
      "Robin: You were just staring at my shirt boobs.\n",
      "Ted: No! I wasn't. I was checking out the hot body underneath the shirt. Okay, look, maybe I was looking at your shirt, but it's a, it's a funny, funny shirt.\n",
      "Chinese 2: Hey, it's Barney! Barney!\n",
      "Barney: Hi.\n",
      "Chinese 2: (speaks Chinese language)...suit up! (both speak Chinese language) Legen-...-dary!\n",
      "Barney: See you.\n",
      "Ted: What the hell was that?\n",
      "Barney: A... Chinese guy?\n",
      "Marshall: Hi. Hello. Uh, we need a marriage license, but we need to skip the waiting period because... We're in love.\n",
      "Woman 2: Aw. I'm gonna waive this waiting period right now.\n",
      "Lily: Oh, really?!\n",
      "Woman 2: Is what I would say if I could waive the waiting period, but unfortunately, only a judge can do that.\n",
      "Lily: Oh. Well, so can we see a judge?\n",
      "Woman 2: Absolutely.\n",
      "Lily: Really?!\n",
      "Woman 2: Is what I would say if there was any chance of you seeing a judge today, which there isn't.\n",
      "Marshall: Why are you doing this to us?!\n",
      "Woman 2: 'Cause you're on Candid Camera!\n",
      "Robin: Really?!\n",
      "Woman 2: Is what I would say...\n",
      "Marshall: You know what? We get it.\n",
      "In a corridor, on a bench.\n",
      "Lily: Okay, this is a good plan B. Judges are people. People go to the bathroom. A judge is bound to come by eventually, and we'll get married. I'm sure we won't be waiting long.\n",
      "(Image fading in old people on the bench)\n",
      "Marshall: Geez, you go to a vending machine for 30 seconds.\n",
      "Barney: Vultures.\n",
      "Ted (to Robin): Psst. (They move away)\n",
      "Robin: What? Here?\n",
      "Ted: Yeah. Got a little time to kill.\n",
      "Robin: Oh, my God, it's the T-shirt, isn't it?\n",
      "Ted: No. A little.\n",
      "Robin: Something is seriously wrong with you.\n",
      "Ted: So what, is that a no?\n",
      "Robin: All right, let's do it.\n",
      "Ted: All right. Um, also...?\n",
      "Robin: Yes, I'll leave it on.\n",
      "Ted: Sweet.\n",
      "Barney: Guys, let's bail. This is never gonna happen.\n",
      "Lily: Look, I know this is turning into a bit of a disaster, but believe me, it's better than the alternative.\n",
      "Barney: You throwing a big, free party with lots of booze and food and all your single, desperate girlfriends from college? Yeah, glad we dodged that bullet.\n",
      "Lily: Judge! Judge, come on. Come on, come on, come on!\n",
      "Judge's office. Lily turns on her musical bouquet.\n",
      "Judge: Turn it off.\n",
      "Lily: Okay. May we please get married today?\n",
      "Judge: Now, normally I would say no to a request like that, but you two impress me. Just the fact that you've been together for ten years, standing by each other's side through thick and thin, never wavering. What was that?\n",
      "Lily: What was what?\n",
      "Judge: That little look. What was that?\n",
      "Marshall: A look of love.\n",
      "Judge: You two have stood together through thick and thin, right?\n",
      "Marshall: You know, what's thick? what's thin?\n",
      "Lily: Yeah, I mean, all... yeah.\n",
      "Marshall: I have.\n",
      "Judge: All right, what was that look? What's going on?\n",
      "Barney: They broke up over the summer. Lily totally ran off to San Francisco and these two just had s*x in the closet. What? We're under oath.\n",
      "Ted: No, we're not.\n",
      "Barney: Yeah, we are. He's a judge.\n",
      "Ted: Wh-- Did we take an oath? Do you even know what an oath is?\n",
      "Barney: Uh, yeah. Courthouse. Oath. We're under it.\n",
      "Casino.\n",
      "Marshall: Guys. It's looking like this isn't gonna happen.\n",
      "Lily: No, Marshall, we are gonna get married today.\n",
      "Marshall: Baby, anyplace we go, we're gonna need a marriage license.\n",
      "Lily: Except international waters. So let's find a ship captain. A ship captain can marry us. There's boats all over this place.\n",
      "Ted: Oh, is that what those wooden things are floating between the garbage?\n",
      "Lily: This is a great idea. This is gonna work. Let's go. (To a woman) Excuse me. Are you a ship captain?\n",
      "Woman: This is my machine.\n",
      "Marshall: I should go talk to her.\n",
      "Robin: No, let me.\n",
      "Ted: Blackjack?\n",
      "Marshall: Yeah.\n",
      "Lily: Well, I found a guy who said he'd be willing to put his boat in my slip, so we're getting closer.\n",
      "Robin: Okay, Lil, why is it so important to do this today?\n",
      "Lily: Because... If we don't do it today, I just know we're gonna wind up having a huge wedding with a huge crowd full of huge Midwestern people looking all disapproving and judging me while sipping little cups of mayonnaise and cracking runaway bride jokes all night long.\n",
      "Robin: Nobody's gonna do that.\n",
      "Lily: No, they're not because I'm not gonna give them the chance. I'm gonna find a ship captain and we're gonna be married tonight.\n",
      "Robin: Sweetie, this is crazy. You're never gonna find a ship capt...\n",
      "Marshall: Hey, Lily. Found a ship captain.\n",
      "Lily: What?\n",
      "Ted: Yeah. First guy we talked to. Ship captain. How great is that?\n",
      "Lily: See? See, this is destiny. So, captain, can you take us out to international waters and marry us?\n",
      "Captain: I sure can. If there's two things I love, it's bringing people together in marriage and making $5,000.\n",
      "Marshall: What?\n",
      "Lily: Deal. $5,000, okay, we can do that. Come on, everybody. Fork over your cash. Don't think. Just do it.\n",
      "Barney: I can get us that money.\n",
      "Ted: How?\n",
      "Barney: Have you noticed that all day today Chinese guys have been coming up and saying hi to me?\n",
      "Ted: Yes. Have you noticed I haven't asked about it because I'm too scared of the answer?\n",
      "Barney: Well, those are my old gambling buddies. Truth is... I used to come here all the time. Play an old Chinese game called \"Shing Hasabu Shing\". Had a small gambling problem. Actually, it wasn't so small. I kind of lost my entire life's savings. But tonight, I don't know, I'm feeling hot. I think I can win us that money.\n",
      "Robin: No, we're not letting you gamble all our money away.\n",
      "Barney: Uh, it's not gambling if you absolutely know you're going to win. I'll get us that money. I swear it, nay... I oath it.\n",
      "Ted from 2030: Now, I had been to a lot of casinos before that night, and I've been to a lot of casinos since, but in all that time I've never seen a game quite like this one. To this day, I have no idea how it was played. But luckily, Barney did.\n",
      "Lily: Do you understand what's happening?\n",
      "Ted: Not a clue.\n",
      "Robin: Do you think he's winning?\n",
      "Ted: I don't even know if he's playing.\n",
      "Marshall: Wait, I get it. I understand this game.\n",
      "Ted: No, you don't.\n",
      "Marshall: I totally understand the game, Theodore. Barney, split your tiles. You can triple your money if you find the jellybean.\n",
      "Barney: Marshall, please. Don't you think I know what I'm... My God, you're right.\n",
      "On the ship.\n",
      "Lily: Wow. It's beautiful.\n",
      "Marshall: Thanks, Barney.\n",
      "Barney: Did you guys see me? I was on fire tonight. Man, I can't wait to get back to the shore. God, I love gambling!\n",
      "Ted: When we get home, we're gonna go to a little meeting. Okay?\n",
      "Barney: Why can't I do it just a little?\n",
      "Lily: Okay. Let's get this started.\n",
      "Captain: Okay, uh... You guys want the serious one or the funny one?\n",
      "Oh, I think. Serious would be best.\n",
      "Captain: You sure? I got a lot of great nautical jokes in there. Like how you two float each other's boat, stuff like that.\n",
      "Marshall: Yeah, serious is probably good.\n",
      "Captain: \"We stand witness today to celebrate the union of Lily and Marshall. Today, you two will become one, sharing your lives, the happiness, the sadness, the frustrations and the joy...\"\n",
      "Ted: This is pretty cool. I can't believe you never want to get married.\n",
      "Robin: I never said \"never.\"\n",
      "Captain: \"...to declare your love and devotion to each other in front of friends and family, all the people who matter most to you.\" What was that?\n",
      "Marshall: What was what?\n",
      "Captain: That little look. You two just shared a look.\n",
      "Lily: We don't want to do this.\n",
      "Marshall: We don't.\n",
      "Ted: Are you kidding me? You guys are calling off another wedding?\n",
      "Robin: After I spent all this money on a bridesmaid shirt?\n",
      "Barney: Did I bet someone that they'd call it off? I did, didn't I? Who'd I bet?\n",
      "Ted: You actually expect any of us are gonna come to your third wedding?\n",
      "Lily: Yes. Because it's gonna be amazing. Look, before I was afraid to face Marshall's family and I didn't want to do all that work, but... Now that we're here... I realize that I have to face Marshall's family and I really want to do all that work.\n",
      "Marshall: So do I. And yeah... My family might still be upset with you. But when they see us up there, they're gonna see how much we love each other and none of that other stuff is gonna matter.\n",
      "Lily: I love you, Marshmallow.\n",
      "Marshall: I love you, too, Lilypad.\n",
      "Captain: I now pronounce you man and wife.\n",
      "Lily: What?!\n",
      "Captain: Is that not right?\n",
      "Marshall: Are... we married? Did you just marry us? Weren't you listening? We don't want to be married.\n",

      "Marshall: Last time James was in town, Barney got slapped once, lucky twice, and... whose penthouse hot tub did you end up in?\n",
      "James: Ah, public figure, confidentiality agreement. But I will say this: way more back hair than any guy who can afford laser hair removal should have.\n",
      "Lily: And then there was the time they scored the brother/sister combo.\n",
      "Barney: It was everything we ever dreamed of when watching Donnie and Marie. She was a little bit country.\n",
      "James:  He was a little bit way into black guys.\n",
      "Tes (voix off): Yeah, Barney and James together was a lethal combination. Since there was never any crossover in targets, James was always there for Barney with the assist.\n",

If gay guys start getting married, then suddenly the whole world's gonna be doing it. That's how it works. They start something, then six months later, everyone follows. Like now everyone gets manicures.\n",
      "Ted: I don't get manicures.\n",
      "Barney: Okay, then like how... Like getting your chest waxed.\n",
      "Lily: You get your chest waxed?\n",
      "Barney: You know what I mean! Gay marriage is going to cause single life, as we know it, to die out. Think of how the American family will be strengthened.\n",
      "Marshall: Barney, I'm sorry you're upset, but you got to suck it up and be a man about this.\n",

      "Ted: And it's never the hot ones. It's always the losers. Bums me out!\n",
      "Lily: Looks like the boys learned their lesson. Do you totally miss being hit on?\n",
      "Robin: Oh, totally. Let's go find a sports bar.\n",
      "Barney: James, James, since you like arts and crafts, look at what Charles here made with cherry stems. He did it with his tongue. Yeah.\n",
      "James: Barney.\n",
      "Barney: So, Charles, why don't you put your number in my brother's phone, and once he's in a funner mood...\n",
      "James: Barney, Barney, I don't want his number. I don't want anyone's number, okay? I'm getting married.\n",
      "Charles: Wow.- Best of luck to you both.\n",
      "James: - Thank you.\n",
      "Charles: My number's in here. I'm very discreet.\n",
      "James: Okay, okay, excuse me. Barney, family talk. Okay, dude, you have got to stop this, okay? I know that my getting married is threatening to your way of life...\n",
      "Barney: Oh, so now it's my way of life? I thought it was our way of life. You've completely turned your back on it. Look at you, not even suited up. Do you remember why we suit up, James?\n",
      "James: To get laid.\n",
      "Barney: To show people that we are different from the millions of T-shirt and jeans lemmings out there. The suit shows that we are a force to be reckoned with, a two-person army that plays by its own rules. But you've taken off the uniform, you've crossed enemy lines, and you've abandoned me. Well, I'm not gonna let you do that. It's not too late to back out of this stupid marriage thing! You don't have to do this, bro!\n",
      "James: - Yes, I do.\n",
      "Barney: - Why?!\n",
      "James: Because Tom and I are gonna have a baby.\n",
      "Barney: What? There's gonna be a baby?\n",
      "James: Yes. We're adopting.\n",
      "Barney: Oh, my God. I'm gonna be an uncle?\n",
      "James: For the rest of your life.\n",
      "Ted (voix off) And that's how Barney became Uncle Barney. A year later, at James's wedding, Barney could not have been more proud.\n",
      "At James's wedding\n",
      "Barney: To James and Tom. May you have a long and happy life together. And may I always have the skin and libido of a much younger man.- Cheers.\n",
      "Tous: - Cheers.\n",
      "Barney: Thanks. I decided to leave out the hetero college phase. No one wants to\n",
      "hear about that.\n",
      "Lily: It was perfect. You even made Tom's dad cry. Might have been doing that because he's a Republican.\n",
      "Marshall: Whoa. It's 9:00. We should be getting back. You guys want to split a cab?\n",
      "Ted: Uh, no, I think I'm gonna stay a little bit longer.\n",
      "Robin: Yeah, me, too. I'm not tired at all.\n",
      "Marshall: All right, well, it's getting late. Got to get the wife home.\n",
      "Lily: Oh, stop calling me that. It makes me sound fat.\n",
      "Barney: Ugh, it's a freaking epidemic.\n",
      "Ted and Robin get up to dance.\n",
      "Barney: - May I?\n",
      "James: - Yeah.\n",
      "James stands un and leaves the baby with Barney.\n",
      "Barney: Hey, buddy. Your parents are married. Now, listen, you. Just because you're being raised by married people doesn't mean you have to choose that lifestyle. High-five. Luckily, you got me. In 20 and a half years, you'll be 21, and I will be... Well, I haven't decided how old I'll be yet. But we are gonna bro out, uncle and nephew style. Stick with me, kid. I am gonna teach you how to live. Great suit, by the way. Who is the cutest?\n",
      "Barney talks with a woman.\n",
      "Rosa: I don't get it. Tom liked my breasts in tenth grade. Why doesn't he like them now? Why?\n",
      "Barney: Rosa, why always be attracted to the unavailable ones? Why not accept the fact that you're a beautiful woman who is worthy of love? Are you brave enough to hear that? You...\n",
      "Ted (V.O.): Kids, as you know, Christmas is a time you spend with your family. So in December of 2006, I had three options. Spend it with my mom and her new boyfriend Clint, spend it with my dad and his new girlfriend micro-brewing, or head down to Staten Island to spend it with my super religious cousin Stacy and her family. So I opted for none of the above and decided to spend Christmas 2006 in Manhattan... celebrating with my other family.\n",
      "Lily is decorating the apartment while Marshall studies\n",
      "Marshall: Okay, I have one last paper due at 5:00 p.m. today, so until then, I will be at the law library at school, but I'm not to be disturbed for any reason.\n",
      "Ted: Dude, open your eyes. You're going to hurt yourself.\n",
      "Marshall: No, no. Christmas Eve winter wonderland is my reward for finishing my paper. Baby, do I smell your Sinfully Cinnamon Cookies?\n",
      "Lily: Yes.\n",
      "Marshall: Damn me and my heightened other senses. Must be strong. Okay, I'll be back here at 5:00. Save me at least 20 cookies and do not clean the bowl. Was that a reindeer? I don't want to know!\n",
      "Lily: Hey, look. Our old answering machine.\n",
      "Ted: Oh, yeah. After you left, we, uh, we unplugged it because it reminded Marshall of how you used to, you know, leave messages. But hey, you guys are back together. I say we're plugging it back in. It's good to have you back.\n",
      "Lily: Thanks. Oh, hey, look, there's still some messages on here.\n",
      "Ted's father: Hey Ted, it's Dad calling to check in. I'm going fishing this\n",
      "weekend with my friend Clint, so if I don't hear from you beforehand, I'll talk to you next week.\n",
      "Ted: Yes, same Clint.\n",
      "Ted (voix dans le répondeur): Hey, Marshall. Are you lying on the couch right now moping about Lily? You are, aren't you? Well, stop it. She's not worth it. You gotta get over that Grinch.\n",
      "Ted (voix off): But I didn't say \"Grinch.\" I said a bad word. A very, very bad word.\n",
      "Ted: Oh, fudge.\n",
      "Ted (voix off): But I didn't say fudge.\n",
      "Lily: I'm... a what?\n",
      "Ted: I-- That was Barney, that was Barney.\n",
      "Lily: That was you, Ted.\n",
      "Ted: That was Marshall.\n",
      "Lily: Marshall left a message for Marshall?\n",
      "Ted: You know, it may have been me, but it was so long ago. Man, that machine, it really garbles your voice.You know, it almost made it sound like I said...\n",
      "Lily: Why would you call me that?\n",
      "Ted (voix off): It was a fair question. Marshall's breakup with Lily had sent him into a deep depression and nothing could get him out of it. Until one day...\n",
      "Marshall is eating on the couch while Ted reads the newspaper.\n",
      "Marshall: She was perfect. I lost the perfect woman. I should have knocked her up when I had the chance.\n",
      "Ted: Okay. That's it. You're never going to get over her until you stop putting her on a pedestal. So no more ice cream until you tell me one thing that's wrong with Lily.\n",
      "Marshall: There's only one of her?\n",
      "Ted: Okay. She called off your wedding and dumped you to be a painter in San Francisco. What do you call that?\n",
      "Marshall: Fiercely independent? Brave? I guess it was a little selfish.\n",
      "Ted: There you go.\n",
      "Ted (voix off): And in almost no time, that spark turned into a roaring fire.\n",
      "Flashback. Marshall, Ted and Barney are at the bar.\n",
      "Marshall: Yeah. No, you're right. Lily would laugh at anything.\n",
      "Barney: She'd give it up for a bad pun. I'm telling you, she's a laugh slut.\n",
      "Ted: Remember that time we heard her laughing and we thought she was watching Weekend At Bernie's, but it turned out she was watching Weekend At Bernie's 2?\n",
      "Barney: And her art? \"I'm Lily, I'm an artist.\" She doesn't even own a beret.\n",
      "Marshall: Yeah, and if she's such a great \"artist,\" why does she suck at Pictionary? Who draws a ninja star like a Star of David? Right, right?\n",
      "Ted: Yeah!\n",
      "Marshall: Another round!\n",
      "End of flashback. Back at the apartment.\n",
      "Ted: I was trying to help him. I'm his best friend. That's the best friend's job.\n",
      "Lily: The best friend's job is to call me that word?\n",
      "Ted: Yeah.\n",
      "Barney, Robin and &auml;Ted are at the bar.\n",
      "Robin: Oh, Ted. Oh, Teddy boy.\n",
      "Ted: Why is this such a big deal? It's just a word. We use lots of words, every day. It shouldn't be any different than any other word.\n",
      "Barney: Then why don't you say it now?\n",
      "Ted: Grinch. You timed that didn't you?\n",
      "Barney: Perfectly.\n",
      "Robin: Well, at least you apologized. You apologized, didn't you?\n",
      "Ted: Oh, yeah. \"I'm sorry\" were the first words out of my mouth.\n",
      "Flashback. Lily and Ted at the apartment.\n",
      "Ted: I'm sorry, but I am not apologizing. I was just trying to put the guy back together. You smashed him to pieces.\n",
      "Lily: Are you seriously not going to apologize for leaving that message?\n",
      "Ted: No!\n",
      "Lily: Why not?\n",
      "Ted: Because, Lily, this summer, you were kind of a Grinch.\n",
      "Lily: Oh, you'll be sorry, Ted Mosby.\n",
      "End of flashback. Back to the bar.\n",
      "Barney: Ted Vivian Mosby!\n",
      "Ted: That's not my middle name.\n",
      "Barney: Do you kiss your mother with that mouth?\n",
      "Ted: Like you've never said that word.\n",
      "Barney: I don't kiss your mother with my mouth. Yet. (Barney sneezes)\n",
      "Ted: Are you sick?\n",
      "Barney: Is it sick to find maturity and experience sexy?\n",
      "Ted: No, I meant do you have a cold?\n",
      "Barney: I'm fine. I'm fine. My nose is just overflowing with awesome and I had to get some of it out. Now, if you'll excuse me, the holidays are a time when people are lonely and desperate. It's the most wonderful time of the year.\n",
      "Ted: I should go apologize. It's Christmas Eve.\n",
      "Robin: Yeah. I mean, slamming doors and screaming curses? If I wanted that, I would have gone home for the holidays.\n",
      "Barney talks to a girl.\n",
      "Barney: I don't see any mistletoe, but... (He sneezes on her)\n",
      "Woman: Oh! Oh, God!\n",
      "Barney: Uh... \"Bless you\" would have been nice.\n",
      "Robin walks Barney home. On the Hallway.\n",
      "Robin: You're sick.\n",
      "Barney: I'm not sick.\n",
      "Robin: You're sick.\n",
      "Barney: You know what? I am sick. Sick of you telling me I'm sick. What up?\n",
      "Barney cough so strongly that he fells.\n",
      "Ted: Ahh... Three flights of stairs, not a drop spilled. Hey, buddy.\n",
      "Robin: You sure this is gonna work?\n",
      "Ted: Yeah, this is our thing. In college, whenever I wanted to make up with her, I'd buy her a beer. Cute, right?\n",
      "Robin: Totally. Plus free mug.\n",
      "Ted (voix off): Usually that would've done the trick, but it turned out this was a problem not even alcohol could solve. Actually the beer helped a little.\n",
      "Ted: She took the decorations. She took the decorations! What a Grinch!\n",
      "Ted (voix off): That time I did say \"Grinch.\"\n",
      "Ted: All right. I guess I have to call her, right? Lily's cell phone. She'll listen to reason-- right? Oh, hey, Billy. Actually, funny thing--the voice dial got you. I was trying to call... Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. (20 minutes later) Yeah, the holidays are a rough time for everyone, Billy. Okay, yeah, dinner next Wednesday. Okay. Damn voice dial.\n",
      "Robin: Barney! What the hell are you doing? Get in here, it's freezing outside. Are you insane?\n",
      "Barney: Hey, blame Lily and her oppressive \"no cigars in the apartment rule.\" God, it's like Marshall's marrying the Taliban. (he sneezes on his hand). High five.\n",
      "Robin: Eww. No. You have to go home and get to bed.\n",
      "Barney: Oh, Robin, my simple friend from the untamed north, let me tell you about a little thing I like to call mind over body. You see, whenever I start feeling sick, I just stop being sick and be awesome instead. True story. Yeah, in two minutes, I'm going to pound a sixer of Red Bull, hop in a cab, play a couple of hours of laser tag, maybe get a spray-on tan. It's gonna be legen... Wait for it... (Barney falls asleep)\n",
      "Ted: Lily!\n",
      "Lily: Merry Christmas, assface.\n",
      "Ted: Um, Lily? Where are the Christmas decorations?\n",
      "Lily: At my apartment.\n",
      "Ted: You want to bring them back so we can celebrate Christmas together-- please?\n",
      "Lily: Ted, do you know what I would do if one of my kindergartners used that kind of language? I would be on the phone with their parents.\n",
      "Ted: Yeah, I'm not a kindergartner.\n",
      "Lily: Exactly. You know what that word means. You know that calling people names is mean and hurtful... assface.\n",
      "Ted: Lily, if you don't bring that stuff back right now, we...\n",
      "Ted to Robin: She hung up.\n",
      "Robin: She's just mad. She'll cool down.\n",
      "The phone rings\n",
      "Ted: Lily...\n",
      "Lily: Don't forget to take the cookies out of the oven... assface!\n",
      "Ted: Damn it! I could be in Cleveland right now making peppermint lager with my dad.\n",
      "Robin: Where are you going?\n",
      "Ted: Marshall gets home in three hours. He's gonna show up--no Lily, no winter wonderland.I gotta get up to the Bronx.\n",
      "Ted goes out slamming the door which wakes up Barney)\n",
      "Barney:...dary.\n",
      "Ted's on the street when his phone rings.\n",
      "Ted: Hey, dude, how's the paper going?\n",
      "Marshall: Screw the paper, how's the winter wonderland? Is it magical?\n",
      "Ted: Oh... so magical.\n",
      "Marshall: When you walk through the door, does it feel like you've been slapped in the face by Christmas?\n",
      "Ted: Sure does. Look, I gotta go.\n",
      "Marshall: Come on, man, describe it! Tell me about the decorations. Is Rudolph there? He is, isn't he? Hi, Rudolph!\n",
      "Ted: Ah, yeah, but, you know... decorations, is that really what Christmas is about?\n",
      "Marshall: Hell, yeah! What else would it be about?\n",
      "Ted: Uh, try the birth of Christ. You know, Christmas-- Christ Mas, which means \"More Christ\" to our Spanish friends.\n",
      "Marshall: Yeah, well, all I know is walking in that door and seeing the winter wonderland and seeing Lily and all you guys, just... I can't wait.\n",
      "Ted: Right. I gotta go.\n",
      "Marshall: Right. Okay.Oh, wait. Ted, Ted, Ted, Ted. One more thing. How about the cookies? Are they delicious?\n",
      "Robin is at the apartment with a fire extinguisher\n",
      "Ted: You know, honestly, they taste a little store-bought. Oh! I got another call.\n",
      "Marshall: Well, tell Lily I love her.\n",
      "Ted:  Right. (he hangs up end takes the other call)- Hello?\n",
      "His mother: Ted Evelyn Mosby!\n",
      "Ted: Oh. Uh, hey, Mom. Merry Christmas.\n",
      "His mother: I just got the most disturbing call from Lily. How could you use such a horrible word?\n",
      "Ted: Oh, God, she called you?\n",
      "His mother: Are you acting out because of the divorce? Is-is this all about Clint?\n",
      "Ted: No, Mom, why would it be about Clint?\n",
      "Clint: Hey, buddy, it's Clint. How you doing, champ?\n",
      "Ted: Hey, Clint. Listen, um, I don't really have time to...\n",
      "Clint: Hey, hey, no, no, no. Ted, Ted. You don't know this yet, but you and I are going to be great friends. Now, the Native Americans have this ritual...\n",
      "Ted hangs up and takes the subway.\n",
      "Barney is in bed and Robin brings hm food.\n",
      "Barney: This is a low moment for the Barnacle. I should be off playing laser tag right now, but instead... Don't look at me. I'm hideous.\n",
      "Robin: You just look like a regular guy.\n",
      "Barney: Exactly. I'm a Ted. I'm wearing elastic-waist fleece pants.\n",
      "Robin: And isn't it more comfy?\n",
      "Barney: Yes.\n",
      "Robin: Come on, you need eat something.\n",
      "Barney: Too weak... to hold... bowl.\n",
      "Robin: Fine, I'll feed you.\n",
      "Barney: Ouchie in my mouth! I don't want it. I want ice cream.\n",
      "Robin: No, you're not having ice cream for dinner just 'cause you're sick.\n",
      "Barney: But my throat hurts.\n",
      "Robin: No!\n",
      "Barney: I hate you!\n",
      "Robin stands up\n",
      "Barney: Don't leave me.\n",
      "Lily is at her apartment when someone knocks on the door.\n",
      "Lily: Who is this?\n",
      "Ted: Pizza delivery.\n",
      "Lily: Hey, you tricked me.\n",
      "Ted: You really thought I was the pizza delivery guy?\n",
      "Lily: No, I knew it was you. I just thought you'd at least bring a pizza.\n",
      "Ted: Yeah, well, I brought a beer, but I gave it to a homeless guy. All right, he took it from me. Now, will you please come home?\n",
      "Lily: No, I'm not spending Christmas with you.\n",
      "Ted: Okay, I'm sorry for calling you a... that word, over the summer, and for saying it again today. And for thinking it a lot on the subway ride over. I had no right to say that. It was hurtful and immature and I'm sorry.\n",
      "Lily: Oh, shut up. You think I don't know your fake apologies by now, Ted Mosby? Huh? You're clearly still mad at me.\n",
      "Ted: I'm not mad at you.\n",
      "Lily: Yes, you are.\n",
      "Ted: I am not mad at you, Lily. Now, can we please just...\n",
      "Lily: I've apologized to Marshall and he's forgiven me and we've moved passed it. Why can't you?\n",
      "Ted: Because you never apologized to me. Marshall's not the only one you walked out on. You leave for three months, you don't even call. Come on, Lily, we're supposed to be friends!\n",
      "Lily: Yeah, some friend, you called me a Grinch.\n",
      "Ted: You were a Grinch!\n",
      "Lily: How can you...\n",
      "Ted: Grinchy, Grinch, Grinch, Grinch, Grinch, Grinch, Grinch.\n",
      "The light goes out\n",
      "Lily: Happy? Now, you've pissed off the big guy upstairs.\n",
      "Ted: Yeah, I'm sure God cares if I...\n",
      "Voice: You use that language again and I'll turn off your water!\n",
      "Lily: That's my super. He lives above me. Great. Thanks to your filthy mouth, now I'm going to have Christmas alone in the dark.\n",
      "Ted: Fine. I don't want to ruin Christmas. You can have the apartment. Don't worry about seeing me there I'll be in Staten Island with my cousin Stacy. Just.... Merry Christmas.\n",
      "Ted walks out lily's apartment.\n",
      "Robin (on the phone): You're spending Christmas Eve with your family? Baby, that sucks. I'm so sorry.\n",
      "Ted: Uh, they're fine. They're just... they're a little weird. You know they don't believe in gifts or Christmas trees. And they think Santa's how Satan spells his name when he wants to trick us.\n",
      "Robin: Well, do you want me to go with you?\n",
      "Ted: Was that a sincere offer?\n",
      "Robin: First tell me your answer.\n",
      "Ted: Stay there. Save yourself. We'll spend all day together tomorrow. Okay. Oh, how's Barney feeling?\n",
      "Robin: You mean the whiney bottomless pit of neediness? He was bugging me, so I spiked his echinacea tea with codeine.\n",
      "Ted: You're gonna be a great mom.\n",
      "Marshall walks into the apartment with a box.\n",
      "Marshall: Holy crap, the magical Christmas season is upon us. And thank God we don't pay for utilities.\n",
      "Lily: Merry Christmas! What's in the box?\n",
      "Marshall: Only the best present for the best girl ever. It took me all day to track it down.\n",
      "Lily: I thought you were writing a paper.\n",
      "Marshall: Ah, naw, I blew that off. I'll get an extension. School's not important. What is that pitter patter on the roof? Could it be the sound of an awesome Christmas story about to come down the chimney? Why, yes, it is. 'Twas the day before Christmas...\n",
      "Flashback. Marshall is at the post office\n",
      "Marshall: It was supposed to arrive, like, five days ago, but then it got lost and rerouted. I checked two other branches, finally they told me it was here.\n",
      "Women: Yeah, all I needed to know was the tracking number. Looks like it's headed out to our regional branch in Poughkeepsie.\n",
      "Marshall: What?No, no, no, no,I need that package today.\n",
      "Women: Listen, the truck already left five minutes ago so unless you want to run after it...\n",
      "Marshall runs after the truck\n",
      "Marshall: Stop! Stop! Stop, please, stop. Stop. Stop the truck. I need a package on your truck. Can I please take a look in back?\n",
      "Truck driver: Sure. But I gotta keep driving my route. I'm running behind.\n",
      "Marshall gets in the truck\n",
      "Truck driver: My bad.\n",
      "Marshall: I'm okay. (out of the truck) Hey, man, thanks for helping me make my fiancee's Christmas.\n",
      "Truck driver: No problem. Too bad I can't deliver all these packages by the end of the day.\n",
      "Marshall: Wait, so some people aren't going to get their gifts in time for Christmas?\n",
      "Truck driver: Sadly, no.\n",
      "Marshall helps the truck driver deliver the gifts. End of flashback. Back at the apartment\n",
      "Marshall: We delivered every single package on that truck. But I still have one package left to give. Yeah, I did. Merry Christmas. Open it, Baby.\n",
      "Lily: Okay. Oh, my God. An Easy Bake Oven! I've wanted one of these ever since I was a little girl. In this exact model. I never told you that. How did you know?\n",
      "Flashback. A month earlier Marshall and Ted are in the bar.\n",
      "Marshall: It's our first Christmas since we got back together. I want to get her something really special. So I'm getting her a jukebox.\n",
      "Ted: Wow, that's a great gift.\n",
      "Marshall: Not really. It's this big and it dispenses gum.\n",
      "Ted: Oh, man, I know something you could get her that would blow her mind. Ready? Eight years ago...\n",
      "Flashback. Ted and Lily are in marshall and Ted's college room.\n",
      "Lily: When I was a kid, all I wanted was an Easy Bake Oven. I begged and I begged, but all I got was a stupid Lego set because my feminist mom didn't want me conforming to traditional gender roles.\n",
      "Ted: Easy Bake Oven--that's what I'm going to call my van.\n",
      "Marshall walks in\n",
      "Ted: Dude... how was the concert?\n",
      "Marshall: I couldn't find the outside.\n",
      "End of flashback. Back to the apartment with Lily and Marshall.\n",
      "Lily: I can't believe Ted remembered after all these years.\n",
      "Marshall: Yeah, and after all that weed. Where is he anyway?\n",
      "Lily: Staten Island.\n",
      "Marshall: Why?\n",
      "Staton island. Ted is in the livingroom with kids.\n",
      "Ted: Okay, don't tell your mom, but I got you guys some presents.\n",
      "A kid: Like the gift of God's love?\n",

      "Kid: Uncle Ted got us presents!\n",
      "Stacy: That's okay, Ted, we'll just give them to charity.\n",
      "Charity: Yay!\n",
      "Stacy: Uh, not you, Charity. I meant the less fortunate. Ted, how would you like to say grace tonight?\n",
      "Ted: Uh, you know what, why don't you say it. I really wouldn't know what to say.\n",
      "Charity: Why don't you recite your favorite passage of scripture.\n",
      "Ted: That's a great idea, Charity. But, really, I don't know. I mean how do you choose your favorite passage? It's the Bible; there's so many... great ones... That one from Pulp Fiction's pretty cool. Doorbell rings. Ooh, I'll get it. Charity, I'm tapping you in.\n",
      "Charity: Dear, Father, thank you for this day, and thank you for bringing this family together. Amen.\n",
      "Ted opens the door and sees everybody. Lily's holding a beer.\n",
      "Stacy: Who is it, Ted?\n",
      "Ted: Uh, it's... it's just, um, carolers. Marshall starts singing. Robin and Barney follow.\n",
      "# Silent night. Holy night... #\n",
      "Lily: I came here to apologize. I'm so sorry, Ted.\n",
      "Ted: I accept. Give me the beer. it is so good to see you guys.\n",
      "Lily: Are you coming home?\n",
      "Ted: Totally. But first, Lily, I owe you an apology.\n",
      "Lily: Oh, for the love of God, are you as sick of apologies as I am?\n",
      "Ted: Yes\n",
      "Lily: Can we just skip the apology and go straight to the forgiving?\n",
      "Ted: Yes. And I promise, I will never ever call you a... you know, again.\n",
      "Lily: That's okay. I was kind of a Grinch.\n",
      "Kid(in the house) What's a Grinch?\n",
      "Ted: Nothing. It's something you shouldn't say.\n",
      "Kid: Mom, what's a Grinch?\n",
      "Stacy spits out the water she had in the mouth.\n",
      "Both kids: Grinch, Grinch, Grinch...\n",
      "Ted ( to the family): Merry Christmas, everybody. Ted takes his coat and leaves (to his friends) Run, run.\n",
      "In the apartment Mashall is eating the cookies.\n",
      "Ted (V.O.): Kids, you remember my first day with Robin.\n",
      "Flashaback. Ted and Robin are at Robin's apartment.\n",
      "Ted: I think I'm in love with you.\n",
      "Robin: What?!\n",
      "End of flashback.\n",
      "Ted (voix off): Well, here's the thing, normal people, you know, people who aren't your dad, usually take longer to say \"I love you.\" Robin went through the usual stages.\n",
      "Flashback. Ted, Robin and Barney are at the apartment.\n",
      "Robin: Spider! Spider!\n",
      "Barney: I left something in the hallway.\n",
      "Ted: Where?\n",
      "Robin: Right there.\n",
      "Ted: Got it.\n",
      "Ted kisses Robin. Barney comes back to the apartment.\n",
      "Ted (voix off): First there's the moment when you think you think it.\n",
      "Ted: Whoa, still alive.\n",
      "Barney leaves the apartment.\n",
      "Ted (voix off): There's the moment you think you know it.\n",
      "Robin is sick and in bed:\n",
      "Robin: Oh, you don't want to kiss me, you'll get sick.\n",
      "Ted still kisses her. Two days later he's the one who's sick.\n",
      "Ted: Totally worth it.\n",
      "Ted (voix off): There's the moment where you know you know it, but you can't yet say it.\n",
      "Ted: All right, it's getting to be that time. I'll talk to you tomorrow?\n",
      "Robin: Good night.\n",
      "Ted: Good night.\n",
      "Robin: Wait, Ted?\n",
      "Ted: Yeah?\n",
      "Robin: Good night.\n",
      "The next morning, Ted walks into Robin's apartment. Robin's on the phone.\n",
      "Robin: Well, great, I'll see you then. Bye, sweetie. (To Ted) Hey. Guess what? My sister Katie is coming to visit next weekend. She gets in on Thursday.\n",
      "Ted: That's awesome. You know what I'm going to do? I'm going to take off work Friday. We're gonna take her to the Empire State Building.\n",
      "Robin: Really? You'd do that?\n",
      "Ted: Of course. Everyone should see the Empire State Building.\n",
      "Ted (voix off): And then there's the moment where you know you know it, and you can't keep it in any longer.\n",
      "Flashback. At Ted's apartment.\n",
      "Robin: Ted.\n",
      "Ted: Yeah?\n",
      "Robin: Falafel.\n",
      "Credits. Robin and lily are at the airport.\n",
      "Lily: Falafel?\n",
      "Robin: Falafel.\n",
      "Lily: Instead of telling Ted you love him, you said \"falafel\"?\n",
      "Robin: I totally choked.\n",
      "Lily: I just don't get it. Why can't you tell Ted you love him?\n",
      "Robin: Oh, come on, this is a big deal for me.\n",
      "Lily: Oh, God, you'd think you never said it to a guy before. No.\n",
      "Robin: Okay, well, I don't usually getthis far in the relationship. I usually take the three-week exit.\n",
      "Lily: Don't tell me you're actually buying into Barney's freeway theory.\n",
      "The whole gang is at the bar\n",
      "Barney: Watch your steps when you get up, kids, 'cause I am about to drop some knowledge. Relationships are like a freeway.\n",
      "Marshall: Wait a minute, a month ago you told me relationships are like a traveling circus.\n",
      "Barney: No, this is new. This trumps that. Freeways have exits. So do relationships. The first exit, my personal favorite, is six hours in. You meet, you talk, you have s*x, you exit when she's in the shower.\n",
      "Robin: So every girl you have s*x with feels the immediate need to shower? Actually, yeah, I get that.\n",
      "Barney: The next exits are four days, three weeks, seven months--that's when you guys are gonna break up, mark your calendars.\n",
      "Ted: What?\n",
      "Barney: Then a year and a half, 18 years, and the last exit-- death. Which, if you've been with the same woman for your entire life, it's like, \"Are we there yet?\"\n",
      "End of flashback. Back with Robin and Lily.\n",
      "Robin: So I've never been on the freeway this long before. I mean, usually by now I find out the guy has some weird personality thing that makes me want to take the next exit.\n",
      "Lily: Yeah, been there. I once dated a guy who could only go to the bathroom when classical music was playing. Okay, it was Marshall.\n",
      "Robin: It's just things are going so well with Ted I just don't want to complicate it.\n",
      "Lily: Relax, it'll happen when it happens. Which is also the advice I gave Marshall to get him over the classical music thing.\n",
      "Robin: Oh, here comes Katie.\n",
      "Lily: Aw, your sister's so cute.\n",
      "Robin: Yeah. This reminds me of when I used to see her coming up the driveway from school, with her little pigtails and her Hello Kitty backpack.\n",
      "Her sister is kissing a boy.\n",
      "Lily: Hello, Kitty.\n",
      "Robin: Oh, no. No. No. No.\n",
      "Katie: Hey, Robin. How are you?\n",
      "Robin: Oh, good. Good. So, who is this... tongue person?\n",
      "Katie: Robin, this is my boyfriend Kyle.\n",
      "Kyle: Looks like hotness runs in the family.\n",
      "Robin: Oh, you said that. Great. So how long have you two been...?\n",
      "Katie: Two whole months.\n",
      "Kyle: Yeah.\n",
      "Katie: He's actually coming to visit family in New York, too. Isn't that great?\n",
      "Kyle: My cousin. He's 23, kind of a wad, but he buys me beer, so...\n",
      "Robin: That's cool. This is my friend Lily.\n",
      "Kyle: Hot.\n",
      "Robin: You say things! Well, come on, let's get you back to my place, we'll get you settled.\n",
      "Katie: Um, actually, I'm going to stay with Kyle tonight.\n",
      "Robin: Uh, no, you're not.\n",
      "Katie: Oh, come on. It's kind of a special night. If you know what I mean.\n",
      "Robin: What? Oh. Oh...\n",
      "The whole gang is at the bar.\n",
      "Robin : I can't believe my baby sister is planning to lose her virginity to a......douche with a faux hawk. This can't happen. You guys have to help me talk her out of it.\n",
      "Marshall: Speech to talk a girl out of having s*x.\n",
      "Ted: Yeah, I don't have any of those.\n",
      "Barney: Discouraging premarital s*x is against my religion.\n",
      "Robin: Please? I'm her older sister. I'm supposed to teach her how to make good and responsible decisions.\n",
      "Lily: It's 2:00 and you've already had three scotch and sodas.\n",
      "Robin: That's why I need your help.\n",
      "They're all at the Empire State Building.\n",
      "Ted (voix off): Robin convinced Katie to stay with her that first night. And the next day, I took everybody to the Empire State Building.\n",
      "Ted: You guys are lucky you came here with an architect. Empire State Building fun\n",
      "fact number one: When construction began on March 17, 1930, the framework rose at a rate of four and a half stories per week. Four and a half stories per week. Four and a half stories per week. There it is. There it is. Come on. These are fun facts, guys, let's have fun with them.\n",
      "Robin: You know, Katie, I have wanted to come to the Empire State Building for so long, but I waited to come here with someone special.\n",
      "Katie: Oh, here we go.\n",
      "Lily: Marshall and I have never been to the Empire State Building either. But I'm so glad I waited to do something so important with my fiancee.\n",
      "Marshall: Speaking of waiting, I signed an abstinence pledge in high school. It's totally cool to wait. And stay away from drugs... other than pot.\n",
      "Katie: You told them?\n",
      "Robin: Oh, okay, yes, I told them. But only because I think you should hear it from other grownups, too. Everyone thinks you should wait. Right, guys?\n",
      "All: Totally. You should wait.\n",
      "Barney: s*x is fun.\n",
      "Robin: See?\n",
      "Katie: You are such a hypocrite. You were only 16 when you lost yours.\n",
      "Robin: Well, how do you know that? You left your diary in your old room slash my new room.\n",
      "Barney: I'll pay you $10,000 for that diary.\n",
      "Katie: Look, I've been dating Kyle for two months now. It's like forever. I mean, we've already done everything else. I mean, we've even...\n",
      "Robin: Oh. La, la, la, la, la.La, la, la, la, la, la, la,la, la, la, la, la.\n",
      "Marshall: Even Kyle gets to do that.\n",
      "Katie: You have no right to tell me not to do it.\n",
      "Robin: But Kyle? Why can't you just wait? Because if you wait, you can get a nice guy like Ted.\n",
      "Katie: Robin, this is happening. Look, I already put it up on my Myspace page. I need a clove.\n",
      "Robin: You smoke now, too?\n",
      "Lily: Oh, remember cloves?\n",
      "Marshall: No!\n",
      "Robin: No \"Aw, remember cloves?\" This can't happen. She's my baby sister, okay? She should be watching The Little Mermaid and drinking Yoohoo, and not having s*x.\n",
      "Ted: Come on, you were only 16 when you had s*x. I was 17.\n",
      "Marshall: We were 18.\n",
      "Ted: Barney was probably 12.\n",
      "Barney: Good one, Ted. I was, uh, six... fourt... How old were you again?\n",
      "Ted: 17.\n",
      "Barney: Dude, me, too.\n",
      "Lily: Barney, you okay?\n",
      "Barney: Yeah, of course. What, you don't believe me? - It was at camp, so I'm...\n",
      "Marshall: What camp?\n",
      "Barney: This place in the Catskills. Look it up. I was there teaching for the summer.\n",
      "Robin: What did you teach?\n",
      "Barney: Uh, dance.\n",
      "Ted: Dance?\n",
      "Barney: Yeah, Ted, dance. Maybe you've heard of it. It was just a simple summer job, but it turned into so much more. Her name was Frances Houseman, but everyone called her Baby.\n",
      "Flashback. Where Barney work that summer.\n",
      "Barney: Sylvia\n",
      "Sylvia: Yes, Mickey?\n",
      "Barney: How you call your loverboy?\n",
      "Sylvia: Come here, loverboy\n",
      "Barney: And if he doesn't answer\n",
      "Sylvia: Oh, loverboy\n",
      "Barney: And if he still doesn't answer?\n",
      "Sylvia: I simply say, baby... Oh, baby. My sweet baby\n",
      "End of flashback. Back to the Empire State Building.\n",
      "Lily: That's Dirty Dancing.\n",
      "Ted: It was on last night.\n",
      "Marshall: No, it was two nights ago. \"She's Like the Wind\" has been stuck in my brain for about 40 hours. I just got it out. Now it's back in. Damn you, Swayze!\n",
      "Lily: Do you remember our first time?\n",
      "Marshall: Yeah. It was back in college.\n",
      "Flashback. 1996. In Marshall and Ted's college room. Marshall and lily are kissing.\n",
      "Lily: Oh, wait, wait. Look... I really want to do this, but... we should make it special, you know? Do this right.\n",
      "Marshall: Okay. You're right. Maybe we could go to the beach and get a house for the weekend.\n",
      "Lily: Yeah, New Year's Eve.\n",
      "Marshall: Okay.\n",
      "Lily: Oh, and we'll light candles and maybe put on some classical music.\n",
      "Marshall: That's not a good idea.\n",
      "Lily: Why not?\n",
      "Marshall: Long story. But maybe we could put on some Al Green and take a bubble bath together.\n",
      "Lily: Oh, yeah, that sounds so good. Oh, I love you, Marshall. I'm so glad we're waiting. (12 minutes later): Oops. End of flashback.\n",
      "Robin: Oh, that's adorable.\n",
      "Ted: Yeah, tell her what happened next.\n",
      "Back to Marshall and lily's flashback.\n",
      "Marshall: That was amazing.\n",
      "Lily: Yeah. Want to do it again?\n",
      "Ted (on the bed of the top): Please don't. End of flashback.\n",
      "Marshall: We said we were sorry.\n",
      "Ted: Yeah, well, then why'd you do it again?\n",
      "Marshall: You know what, I loaned you my Walkman.\n",
      "Lily: The point is no matter what, it's never gonna be as perfect as you want it to be.\n",
      "Robin: Well, mine was terrible.\n",
      "Lily: Wait, I've never heard your story.\n",
      "Robin: Well, as you know, I was 16. And it was with my boyfriend Brian.\n",
      "Flashback. Robin's in bed with Brian.\n",
      "Brian: Ready?\n",
      "Robin: Yeah.\n",
      "Brian: This feels so right.\n",
      "Robin: Oh, I know.\n",
      "Brian: Oh, Robin.\n",
      "Robin: Oh, Brian.\n",
      "Brian: Yeah, I'm gay. End of flashback.\n",
      "Lily: I'm so sorry.\n",
      "Robin: Eh, I should've known. There were signs.\n",
      "Back to Robin's flashback.\n",
      "Brian: Oh, my God! My mom's home. Quick! Get under my bed.\n",
      "Robin: What?! Oh, my God!\n",
      "End of flashback.\n",
      "Robin: You only get one shot at losing your virginity. And even though I just barely had s*x, it counts.\n",
      "Lily: What do you mean just barely?\n",
      "Robin: Well, he didn't dive all the way into the pool, but he... splashed around in the shallow end.\n",
      "Lily:  Then you didn't lose your virginity to him. Just barely doesn't count.\n",
      "Robin: Yes, it does.\n",
      "Lily: No, it doesn't.\n",
      "Marshall: Yes, it does.\n",
      "Lily: No, it doesn't. It doesn't count. End of story.\n",
      "Barney: Ooh, why, Lily Aldrin, you saucy little harlot. Could it be that before Marshall took a swim, someone else tested the water?\n",
      "Marshall: No. Nobody else tested the water, right? Scooter?\n",
      "Barney: Who's Scooter?\n",
      "Lily: My high school boyfriend, who I did not have s*x with.\n",
      "Marshall: I... I can't believe this. We're Marshall and Lily, when people see us, they say, \"Oh, look at them, they've only had s*x with each other.\"\n",
      "Barney: No, Marshall, they say, (with a sad voice) \"Oh, look at them, they've only had s*x with each other.\"\n",
      "Marshall: But now that's not true anymore, now you've had s*x with twice as many people as I have. I knew that you were too good at it.\n",
      "Katie: Know what? I don't want to see the stupid Empire State Building anymore.\n",
      "Ted: It's not stupid.\n",
      "Katie: I'm going to see Kyle.\n",
      "Robin: Katie, please. You only get to lose your virginity once. You should only be having s*x with someone who's special.\n",
      "Katie: Oh, please, you've had s*x with, like, a hundred guys.\n",
      "Robin: It's not a hundred guys. It's not a hundred guys.\n",
      "Katie: I'm sure you were madly in love with all of them.\n",
      "Robin: I had different levels of feeling for each of the... very reasonable number of guys.\n",
      "Katie: Really. Well, do you love Ted? Do you love Ted?\n",
      "Robin: I, um...\n",
      "Ted: Okay, Empire State Building fun fact number 22: The Empire State Building has tons of places where people can have private conversations. ( goes away with Robin) You're off the hook, okay?\n",
      "Robin: Just let me explain.\n",
      "Ted: You don't have to explain anything. You don't have to say it-- it's fine.\n",
      "Robin: Okay, but if relationships are like a freeway, then saying... \"hm hm hm\" is like... getting into the carpool lane. And I don't want to take an exit, but... at the same time, I'm not ready to get into the carpool lane. Because what's in the carpool lane? Oh, it's a big diamond, and I'm just not ready to get...\n",
      "Ted: Okay, Robin, Robin, stop. It's no big deal, you don't have to say it.\n",
      "Robin: It's just, it's a big thing to say to someone, and I don't want to say it too soon.\n",
      "Ted: What, you mean like I did?\n",
      "Robin: No. I didn't... Yeah, like you did. I mean, you have to admit it, Ted, it was a little weird.\n",
      "Ted: Weird... or courageous?\n",
      "Robin: Pretty sure weird. I mean, who gives it up on the first date?\n",
      "Ted: Well, come on, it shows I'm brave and bold, like a knight.\n",
      "Robin: No, it shows that you're an I-love-you slut.\n",
      "Ted: Well, then you're an I-love-you prude. You know what? I take mine back.\n",
      "Robin: You... What?\n",
      "Ted: I take my \"I love you\" back.\n",
      "Robin: You can't take it back.\n",
      "Ted: Nah. Just did. Got it right here. But, you know, I'm such a slut. I'm just gonna give it away. Hey, you, sir. I love you.\n",
      "Man: Thank you, man. I was going up there to jump. (the man hugs Ted)\n",
      "Lily: Marshall, why is this such a big deal?\n",
      "Marshall: Why is this such a big deal? Oh, uh, sorry, Christopher Columbus, guess who actually discovered the New World. Some dude named Scooter. Oh, uh, Neil Armstrong, it actually goes like this: \"One small step for man, one giant leap for Scooter.\" Whoa, hey, Adam, guess who got with Eve before you did...\n",
      "Lily: Okay, Marshall, I get it.\n",
      "Marshall: It's a big deal because it rewrites our history.\n",
      "Lily: No, it doesn't. Look, have you been to the Empire State Building? No. You've only been in the lobby. People don't buy tickets to get in the lobby. They buy tickets to get to the top. Scooter only got in the lobby, and the lobby doesn't count.\n",
      "Marshall: Really. Excuse me, sir, uh, can you tell me how to get to the Empire State Building?\n",
      "Man (the same that talked to Ted) Um, we're in it right now.\n",
      "Marshall: Thank you, sir. You're a very wise and brilliant man.\n",
      "Man: You're right. Why would I throw that all away? I'm having the best day!\n",
      "Robin: Katie, I'll admit, maybe I'm not in any place to lecture you on romantic relationships, but... but I just don't want you to make the same mistakes that I've made.\n",
      "Katie: Oh, believe me, Kyle is not gay.\n",
      "Robin: That's not what I meant. I just wish you weren't in such a rush to grow up. Please don't do this.\n",
      "Ted (V.O.) : But, kids, later that night, Katie did it, and she got pregnant... with quintuplets... and she lived out her days in a trailer park... where she died an alcoholic. So the moral here, kids, don't have s*x until you're married. Maybe even, like, a year or two into marriage.\n",
      "His kids: Dad!\n",
      "The girl: Come on, what really happened?\n",
      "Ted (V.O.): All right, here's what really happened.\n",
      "Ted is sitting on the couch at the apartment when Robin comes in.\n",
      "Robin: Hey.\n",
      "Ted: Hey.\n",
      "Robin: She didn't do it.\n",
      "Ted: Hey, that's great! You got through to her.\n",
      "Robin: No, I didn't. You did. She told me that you talked to her.\n",
      "Flashback. Ted meets Katie et the Empire State Building.\n",
      "Ted: Hey, Katie.\n",
      "Katie: Hey. Got another Empire State Building fun fact for me?\n",
      "Ted: No. I wouldn't bore you with the seven million man-hours it took to build this 102-story testament to human will. So, you okay?\n",
      "Katie: I don't know what everyone is freaking out about. Kyle, he's a really nice guy. He could've cheated on me with my lab partner Gretchen Gwynn, but he didn't. 'Cause he said he knew I'd find out.\n",
      "Ted: That's very gallant. Well, I don't know what your sister's freaking out about, either. - I was your age my first time.\n",
      "Katie: Oh, really?\n",
      "Ted: Yeah, yeah. It was, uh, it was with this girl, Molly.\n",
      "Flashback. Ted is on the bed with molly.\n",
      "Molly: I love you, Ted.\n",
      "Ted: Oh, I love you, too, Molly. (Voix off ) But I didn't.\n",
      "Molly: That was amazing.\n",
      "Ted: Look, I got to go.\n",
      "Molly: Where are you going?\n",
      "Ted: My cousin got some firecrackers from Mexico. We're going out to the woods to light 'em-- it's gonna be awesome.\n",
      "Molly: Well, will you call me?\n",
      "Ted: Yeah. Yeah, I'll totally call you. (Voix off) But I didn't. Molly?\n",
      "Molly: Yeah?\n",

      "End of flashback. Back to Katie and Ted.\n",
      "Ted: And I never saw her again. I told her I loved her, but... I just wanted to have s*x. I-I would've said anything to make that happen, and... that's exactly what I did. Look, I'm not telling you what to do. I'm just telling you what all 17-year-old boys are like. Even the nice ones.\n",
      "Flashback. Katie's at Robin apartment.\n",
      "Katie: So I told Kyle I wanted to wait... and he dumped me.\n",
      "Robin: Oh, oh, sweetie, I'm so sorry. Aw, honey. I promise everything is gonna be okay. You want to watch The Little Mermaid and drink some YooHoo?\n",
      "Katie: Only if you put a buttload of Kahlua in it.\n",
      "Robin: Don't tell Mom.\n",
      "End of flashbacks. Back to robin and Ted.\n",
      "Robin: Thanks for doing that.\n",
      "Ted: You're welcome. I knew it meant a lot to you.\n",
      "Robin: But, man, your story, I mean, it doesn't even sound like you.\n",
      "Ted: Yeah, well...\n",
      "Flashback. Ted and molly are on the bed.\n",
      "Ted: I love you, Molly.\n",

      "Ted: Wow. That was amazing.\n",
      "Molly:  Look, I got to go.\n",
      "Ted: Wh-Where are you going?\n",
      "Molly: Uh, my cousin got some firecrackers from Mexico. We're going into the woods to light them. It's gonna be awesome.\n",
      "Ted: Will you call me?\n",
      "Molly: Yeah. I'll totally call you. Oh, Ted?\n",
      "Ted: Yeah?\n",
      "Molly: Can I borrow 20 bucks? I'll totally pay you back.\n",

      "Ted: But she didn't.\n",
      "Robin: Oh, come here. I love you. I said it. Feels right. I love you.\n",
      "Ted: I'm gay. I'm kidding. I love you, too. Hey... you lost your I-love-you-ginity.\n",
      "Robin: Yeah. I guess I was just waiting for the right guy.\n",
      "Ted (voix off): Katie ended up having a great first time in New York. And the last thing we did before she left was go to the Empire State Building.\n",
      "Ted: I am so glad we're finally doing this.\n",
      "Barney: What are you talking about? We were here yesterday.\n",
      "Marshall: Yeah, but that didn't really count. Oh, crap.\n",
      "Lily: Exactly! So yesterday doesn't count as having gone to the Empire State Building. So I lost it to you, Marshall. And I rode that elevator to the top, and I saw that view, and I basked in the awesomeness. And that's our story.\n",
      "Marshall: Yeah. Yeah, that's our story. We've only had s*x with each other.\n",
      "Lily: We've only had s*x with each other.\n",
      "Barney: They've only had s*x with each other.\n",
      "Ted: Ooh, okay, in, in we go, in we go. Okay, Empire State Building fun fact number 81: There are 1,860 steps from this... (They push him outside the elevator) Whoa, whoa! Come on!\n",
      "They're at the bar.\n",
      "Ted: So, now you guys can finally say you've been to the Empire State Building. How have you lived here so long and never been to the top?\n",
      "Marshall: Well, we're usually busy... drinking.\n",
      "Lily: Speaking of first times, we never got to hear your virginity story.\n",
      "Marshall: That's right, I almost forgot.\n",
      "Barney: Okay. I was 16, and it was in a baseball dugout...\n",
      "Marshall: Fast Times at Ridgemont High.\n",
      "Barney: I mean, I was in a subway with a high-priced call girl...\n",
      "Ted: Risky Business.\n",
      "Barney: I was accidentally hacking into NORAD'S computer...\n",
      "Ted: That's War Games, and there's not even a s*x scene in it.\n",
      "Barney: All right! I was 23, and it was with my mom's 45-year-old divorced friend, Rhonda. She called me \"Barry\" the whole time, and for two weeks, my comforter smelled like menthol cigarettes. You happy?\n",
      "Marshall: Hey... Why don't you tell us again about your first time at the camp in the Catskills.\n",
      "Barney: Baby and her family spent every summer at Kellerman's. Her dad did not approve of our love.\n",
      "Ted: Did anyone put Baby in a corner?\n",
      "Flashback. In 1982, Ted is building a tower with legos.\n",
      "Ted (voix off): Some kids dream of being astronauts. Some kids dream of playing baseball. When I was a kid, I had only one dream. To build a skyscraper.\n",
      "Boy: That's stupid. (he destroys Ted's tower.)\n",
      "End of flashback\n",
      "Ted (voix off): There were some obstacles along the way. But eventually my dream came true. I became an architect.\n",
      "Ted at work.\n",
      "Ted: Morning, everyone! So, I had an idea for the atrium. Ready? Columns.\n",
      "Mr. Druthers: That's stupid. (he destroys his model)\n",
      "Credits.\n",
      "Ted: I... I can't believe you knocked over my model.\n",
      "Mr Druthers: Well, it's just... it's not exactly new, is it-- columns? I mean, what's your next groundbreaking idea-- ceilings? Floors? Windows?\n",
      "Ted (voix off): I know what you're thinking: Who's this jerk? Well, this jerk was Hammond Druthers, a legend in the architecture community. Very big in the '80s. He was also far and away the worst boss I ever had. Then I designed the Spokane National Bank Building. And suddenly... I was his boss. - And he didn't like it.\n",
      "Mr Druthers: Stairs?\n",
      "Ted (voix off): And to be honest, I wasn't sure I liked it either. See, before, when I was just another employee, I was happy, carefree. The guy who hung out in the break room making fun of the boss.\n",
      "Flashback. Ted's in the break room with two co-workers.\n",
      "Ted: Did you see what he was wearing today? It was like his pants were being held up by his nipples.\n",
      "Co-worker: Yeah, and that shirt with the flowers, I get hay fever just looking at it.\n",
      "Ted (voix off): But suddenly I was a different guy.\n",
      "Ted's in the break room with two co-workers.\n",
      "Ted: Hey, guys. What's so funny?\n",
      "Co-worker: Nothing. Um... nice shirt.\n",
      "Ted: Thanks.\n",
      "Ted (voix off): The hours were insane. I was always working even when I wasn't at work.\n",
      "Ted and Robin are on the bed. Robin is sleeping.\n",
      "Ted: Oh, Robin... I just had a great idea.\n",
      "Robin: Oh, do whatever you want to me just don't wake me up.\n",
      "Ted (voix off): Before, I used to be this guy.\n",
      "Ted: Dude, of course you should take the day off for the Foo Fighters concert. Just say you're sick.\n",
      "Ted (voix off): But now...I was this guy.\n",
      "Ted: Sick, huh? Unbutton your shirt. Hmm... \"Foo Fighters.\" Get back to work.\n",
      "Ted (voix off): But still, the worst part was Druthers.\n",
      "End of flashback. Back to work.\n",
      "Ted: Well, I was thinking...\n",
      "Mr Druthers: Ceilings? Oops. Said that already. Then again, you seem to like rehashing old ideas. I'm kidding, of course. Another hole in one, boss.\n",
      "The whole gang's at the bar.\n",
      "Robin: Oh, wow, he must be really good-looking.\n",
      "Ted: Why would you say that?\n",
      "Robin: Well, 'cause only good-looking people can get away with saying things like that.\n",
      "Barney: I have found that to be true.\n",
      "Marshall: It's a blessing and a curse really.\n",
      "Lily: Ted, you can't let him treat you like that.\n",
      "Marshall: Yeah, you gotta ask yourself, who's the boss?\n",
      "Ted: Tony.\n",
      "Robin: Angela.\n",
      "Barney: Mona.\n",
      "Robin: Mona?\n",
      "Barney: Watch it more closely. Rock your world.\n",
      "Robin: So, what are you gonna do?\n",
      "Ted: Well... it's awkward, I mean, the guy used to be my boss. So, I went to talk to the managing partner.\n",
      "Flashback. Ted is with the Managing Partner.\n",
      "MP: Fire him.\n",
      "Ted: Well, sir, I was thinking he could just be put on a different project.\n",
      "MP: Fire him! He's an arrogant, washed-up, pain in the ass. In fact, fire everyone on that project. Druthers, Mosby, the whole lot of them.\n",
      "Ted: Mosby, sir? I, I... I hear Mosby's doing some great work.\n",
      "MP: Fine, Mosby can stay. But tell him he's on thin ice. Come here. I like you, Crosby.\n",
      "End of flashback. Back at Ted's apartment.\n",
      "Barney: You mind if I charge my phone?\n",
      "Ted: Knock yourself out.\n",
      "Robin: Well, Ted, if you do fire Druthers, the key is timing. Remember when I had to fire my makeup artist?\n",
      "Flasback Robin's work.\n",
      "Robin: Vicki, um... I'm so sorry about this, but there's been some budget cuts and, um, we have to let you go. I mean, after tonight. I still need my makeup for the broadcast. So... (Robin on TV wearing a lot of make-up.): Our thoughts and prayers go out to the families of the victims.\n",
      "End of flashback\n",
      "Ted: You know what? I'm gonna do it. I'm gonna fire Druthers tomorrow.\n",
      "Barney: Oh, my God! (barney's holding a painting)\n",
      "Ted: What?\n",
      "Barney: Do you know about this?\n",
      "Ted: No.\n",
      "Robin: What is that?\n",
      "Barney: Only the greatest thing ever. Wait, wait, wait-- that's not enough buildup. If they were to cure cancer tomorrow, this would still be the greatest thing to happen all week. Okay. Now you're ready for naked Marshall.\n",
      "Ted: Oh, my God. This is awesome times awesome. It's awesome squared.\n",
      "Barney: I know, right? Behind the piano this whole time.\n",
      "Robin: Wait. If Marshall went to all this trouble to hide it, he clearly doesn't want us to find it.\n",
      "Barney: Oh, come on, Robin.\n",
      "Robin: No, I'm saying that he must be really embarrassed by this. We are gonna have so much fun.\n",
      "Barney: I know! We're gonna have so much fun!\n",
      "At Ted's work.\n",
      "Mr Druthers: Oh, sorry I'm late; lunch ran a little long. You wanted to see me, Mosby?\n",
      "Ted: Uh, yeah, like four hours ago.\n",
      "Mr Druthers: Well, excuse me, for spending the last four hours drawing designs for your building.\n",
      "Ted: This is a cocktail napkin. Covered in profanity. Look, Hammond, um, there's no easy way to say this, so... why don't we just, um, step into your office.\n",
      "The others employees come with a cake and singing.\n",
      "Employees: Happy birthday to you.\n",
      "Mr Druthers: Oh, you had me. You so had me.\n",
      "In Ted's apartment.\n",
      "Robin: So, you didn't fire him?\n",
      "Ted: I can't fire a guy on his birthday. Everyone would hate me. Besides, they put a party hat on me. My authority was compromised.\n",
      "Barney: Oh, hey, Marshall. Have a seat. I know how much you love stools.\n",
      "Marshall: Thanks. Yeah, stools are better for your posture.\n",
      "Robin: And, uh... I... got you a rose.\n",
      "Marshall: Thank you. That's so sweet. You guys are being... so sweet.\n",
      "Barney: Hey, guys. Guess what I got. A new dart.\n",
      "Robin: Oh, wow, a new dart.\n",
      "Ted: Hey, that new dart is great.\n",
      "Robin: I did not know you were such a fan of new dart, Barney.\n",
      "Barney: Oh, yes, Robin, I just love new dart. Nude art.\n",
      "Ted:  Nude art.\n",
      "Robin:  Nude art.\n",
      "Marshall: Okay, all right, so what, you guys found the painting, huh?\n",
      "Lily: I knew this day would come.\n",
      "Marshall: How did you know that?\n",
      "Lily: Because I didn't hide it very well.\n",
      "Flashback. In 1998, lily's on the bad while marshall's playing a videogame.\n",
      "Ted (voix off): So the story on the painting is that,back in college, Lily wanted to do a nude study for her art class. Marshall wasn't so into the idea.\n",
      "Marshall: Well, I just... don't think that some dude should drop trou just to pose for you.\n",
      "Lily: It's for class, and it's just that weird kid Hunter from my freshman hall.\n",
      "Marshall: The frisbee dude with the soul patch? He's like the hottest guy in school!\n",
      "Lily: No, he's actually a little husky...\n",
      "Marshall: Oh, he's just huggable! And complicated... and a little bit of a jerk. Just enough so you think maybe you can change him.\n",
      "Lily: Okay, just forget it.\n",
      "Marshall: Call me old-fashioned, I just think that I'm the only guy you should see naked.\n",
      "Lily: Well, then you'll have to do it.\n",
      "Marshall: Are you kidding me? What if somebody sees it?\n",
      "Lily: We're not in high school anymore. People don't make fun of you for posing nude for a painting. We're adults now.\n",
      "End of flashback.\n",
      "Barney: We totally saw your butt.\n",
      "Marshall: This painting has caused too much grief already. I'm destroying it right now.\n",
      "Barney: Oh, no, what's the matter, Marshall?\n",
      "Marshall: Where is it?\n",
      "Barney: I'll tell you where it is if you'll answer these riddles three.\n",
      "Marshall: You hung it up in the bar, didn't you?\n",
      "Barney: Yo, why you gotta ruin my riddles?\n",
      "Ted: Field trip!\n",
      "Marshall comes running into the bar with the others\n",
      "Barney: Oh, no. Someone put your painting up behind the bar. Classic! What a memorable prank.\n",
      "Carl: Hey, Marshall. What'll you have?\n",
      "Marshall: What'll I have? Um, I don't know, maybe a beer and that nude painting of me hanging behind the bar!\n",
      "Carl: Ooh, I'm sorry, that painting's property of the bar.\n",
      "Marshall: I know that Barney gave you that painting.\n",
      "Carl: I don't know what you're talking about.\n",
      "Marshall: Whatever he's paying you, I'll pay you double.\n",
      "Carl: I doubt it.\n",
      "Marshall: Whatever he's paying you, I'll give you that plus ten bucks.\n",
      "Carl: I doubt it.\n",
      "Marshall: All right, you know what, Carl, you just lost yourself a regular customer.\n",
      "Carl: I doubt it.\n",
      "Marshall: This painting is the worst thing that's ever happened to me.\n",
      "Robin: Okay, where should we put it up next? In his law school? Ooh on the side of a bus. Oh, oh! How much do billboards cost?\n",
      "Barney: Easy, Scherbatsky. Finesse. I've got a five-year rollout plan. I'll have you know that painting's got commitments all over the city. Then, after New York...\n",
      "Marshall runs to the painting, takes it and goes out yelling.\n",
      "Ted: One of my worst fears has come true-- I just saw Marshall grabbing himself naked. Well, I gotta go. Believe it or not, I have to go back to the office.\n",
      "Robin: Oh, I'll go out with you. Bye, guys.\n",
      "Ted and Robin leave. There's only Lily ant Barney left.\n",
      "Lily: You know, I wish everyone didn't have to make fun of that painting.\n",
      "Barney: Eh, we're not making fun of the painting, we're just making fun of Marshall. The painting's actually really great.\n",
      "Lily: Are you serious?\n",
      "Barney: Yeah.\n",
      "Lily: Well, thank you. You know, seeing it again makes me miss painting nudes. What?\n",
      "Barney: Paint me.\n",
      "Lily: What?\n",
      "Barney: Paint me.\n",
      "Ted is at the office.\n",
      "Voice: Who's that? Who's out there?\n",
      "Ted: Hammond, is that you?\n",
      "Mr Druthers: Mosby?\n",
      "Ted (voix off): Druthers and I were alone in the office. If I was gonna fire him, this would be the best chance I'd ever have.\n",
      "Mr Druters: Uh, look, just a second, Ted.\n",
      "Ted: Uh, no, I, I really need to talk to you. Look, there's no easy way to say... What, what are you doing?\n",
      "Mr Druthers: What are you doing?\n",
      "Ted: I'm standing here wearing pants. Are you sleeping here? What's going on?\n",
      "Mr Druthers: Okay, fine, yes. Not that it's any of your business but my wife had a little spat a few weeks ago, and I've been sleeping here until she cools off.\n",
      "Ted: Okay, well, uh, you're right-- that is none of my business. Uh, look, there's no easy way to say this-- I...\n",
      "Mr Druthers: Who am I kidding? She's never gonna take me back.\n",
      "Ted: It's okay.\n",
      "Mr Druthers: What did you want to say to me?\n",
      "Ted: Happy birthday, buddy. So, you've been living at the office?\n",
      "Mr Druthers: Yes. I'm an architect without a home. You see the tragic irony in that?\n",
      "Ted: Yeah, I do.\n",
      "Mr Druthers: Cause I design homes.\n",
      "Ted: I see it.\n",
      "Mr Druthers: But I don't have a home.\n",
      "Ted: Not lost on me at all. But I don't understand, why don't you just go to a hotel? You could be sleeping on a mattress instead of... what appears to be torn-up drawings of my building.\n",
      "Mr Druthers: Why would I go to a hotel, when any second, she's going to call and tell me to come home. She's a very special lady, Ted. She's quite... mannish. She gives me what I need. Do you understand that?\n",
      "Ted: Uh, no, I don't.\n",
      "Mr Druthers: If you were lost in the wilderness, she can provide for me.\n",
      "Ted: Well, that's the dream.\n",
      "Mr Druthers: I'm glad you came here tonight, Ted.\n",
      "Ted: Me too, Hammond.\n",
      "Mr Druthers: Call me Ham.\n",
      "Ted: No, thanks.\n",
      "Mr Druthers: Hammy D?\n",
      "Ted: No, I think just Hammond.\n",
      "Robin and Ted are at the apartment. Mr Druthers is on the couch.\n",
      "Robin: So, I'm guessing you didn't fire him.\n",
      "Ted: I was this close.\n",
      "Ted (voix off): Meanwhile, Lily had been up all night in the grips of a dilemma.\n",
      "Lily's trying to wake up marshall.\n",
      "Lily: Oh honey, you're awake?\n",
      "Marshall: I'm awake. Is everything okay?\n",
      "Lily: Yeah. I've kind of been wrestling with something. What if I told you I had a way to pay for our honeymoon?\n",
      "Marshall: Baby, our honeymoon's already paid for. We're going to Howe Caverns.\n",
      "Lily: Well yeah, but-- but what if we didn't want to spend our honeymoon in a cave?\n",
      "Marshall: It's not just a cave, it's a whole labyrinth of caves. It's an underground adventure. There's a cave that's so dark that you don't even know you're in there. I mean, we're going to experience a whole new kind of dark.\n",
      "Lily: Well, what if I found a way to make a little extra money so that we spend our honeymoon not in Howe Caverns, but in Scotland?\n",
      "Marshall: Loch Ness?\n",
      "Lily: Yeah. And you know, Edinburgh and the Highlands and Glasgow...\n",
      "Marshall: Loch Ness. Nessy. Baby, I would love to search for the enchanted creature of the Emerald Loch, but... we can't afford that.\n",
      "Lily: Maybe we can.\n",
      "Flashback. Barney and lily are at Mclaren's.\n",
      "Barney: Paint me.\n",
      "Lily: Okay, I don't get this. You've been making fun of that painting all this time and now you want me to paint you?\n",
      "Barney: We knew we could torture Marshall because he has shame. I do not. In my body, where the shame gland should be, there's a second awesome gland. True story.\n",
      "Lily: Yeah, that's not the gland I'm worried about painting.\n",
      "Barney: Yeah. A nude Barney is a challenge. But I think you're talented enough to immortalize this. Now is the time-- I'm 31. I'm at the peak of my physical beauty. If I were a woman, I'd have passed it long, long ago. Long ago.\n",
      "Lily: Forget it. I promised Marshall he was the only guy I would ever see naked.\n",
      "Barney: I'll give you $5,000.\n",
      "End of flashback. Back to Lily and Marshall.\n",
      "Marshall: We're going to Loch Ness!\n",
      "Lily: Yeah!\n",
      "Ted arrives at the office.\n",
      "Ted: That cabby would not shut up.\n",
      "Mr Druthers: Yeah, we should call him a gabby.\n",
      "Ted: I think it, you say it.\n",
      "Mr Druthers: Hey, uh... thanks for putting me up last night, buddy. Give 'em hell.\n",
      "Ted: Morning, team. So, I have given it some thought, and I say we revisit columns.\n",
      "Mr Druthers: Oh, God, not this again. Ted, a man in a toga just arrived and delivered a parchment. Let me read it: Oh! It's from ancient Greece. They want their basic architectural elements back. Geez.\n",
      "Ted: What?\n",
      "Mr Druthers: You didn't hear me? Toga, parchment...\n",
      "Ted: Can I see you for one second?\n",
      "Mr Druthers: Ooh, I'm in trouble now.\n",
      "Ted: What are you doing? I thought we were friends. You slept on my couch, you ate my cereal. I tossed you more toilet paper.\n",
      "Mr Druthers: We are friends. But that doesn't magically make your bad ideas good.\n",
      "Ted: What? I don't believe this! You're, you're, you're wearing my clothes! And my\n",
      "girlfriend's... sneakers, man, you have weirdly small feet.\n",
      "Mr Druthers: Ted, I hope that you're not going to let our professional woes interfere with our friendship, because I really kind of need you right now.\n",
      "Lily is with Barney in the room.\n",
      "Lily: Okay, let's get this over with.\n",
      "Barney: Hey, hey! I don't want you phoning this in. This painting could, someday, become a serious work of art. I mean, you have been blessed with an amazing gift.\n",
      "Lily: Thank you.\n",
      "Barney: I meant me. Now, I like how you captured Marshall's essence. Goofy and unburdened, with wit. But me, I want something more regal. Something my progeny could look at and say, \"There's stands Barnabus Stinson.\" He was wise... and strong.\n",
      "Lily: I don't think your sword will fit.\n",
      "Barney: I get that a lot.\n",
      "Ted (voix off): And so, as Lily began painting, Marshall thought about the $5,000 and what his fiancee was doing to earn it.\n",
      "Marshall is at the bar with money on his hands.\n",
      "Marshall: This isn't right. This isn't right at all.\n",
      "Ted (voix off): Finally, he could take it no more.\n",
      "Back to the room where lily's painting.\n",
      "Lily: Hold still. Hold still. Hold still!\n",
      "Barney: Paint faster!\n",
      "Lily: Okay, I guess it's time. Drop your shorts.\n",
      "Barney: Yeah. Wait, wait! That wasn't enough buildup. I need... In a world without justice, one man...\n",

      "Barney: All right.\n",
      "Marshall comes in.\n",
      "Marshall: No! No, this is not right!\n",
      "Barney: We had a deal!\n",
      "Marshall: Well, I'm going back on the deal. Barney, get out!\n",
      "Barney: You...!\n",
      "Marshall: It's over! (he closes the door at Barney's face). (Yelling) Lily, I can't let you go through with this! (whispering) I found a castle we can stay in, but it's an extra two grand. (Yelling) It's just not right! (whispering). It's beautiful and they say it's haunted.\n",
      "(Yelling) I can't let the woman I love compromise her values for money! (whispering) I totally think we can get some more money out of him. (Yelling) I'm never letting my\n",
      "fiancee, ever...! (he opens the door) Oh, you're still here?\n",
      "Barney: Before you say anything, I'll give you an extra five grand.\n",
      "Marshall:  We accept.\n",
      "Barney: You people are so easy to control. Dance for me, puppets, dance.\n",
      "Ted (voix off): And that's how Uncle Barney paid for Lily and Marshall's honeymoon.\n",
      "Ted is at the office.\n",
      "Mr Druthers: Come on, Ted, listen, why don't we get back and finish drawing the plans for a building which, in my opinion, is never going to get built, so you and I can get out of here and grab a couple of beers.\n",
      "Ted: No. Look, Hammond, there's no easy way to say this but...\n",
      "Man: Looking for Hammond Druthers.\n",
      "Mr Druthers: Oh, that's me. I'm Hammond Druthers.\n",
      "Man: These are divorce papers. You've been served.\n",
      "Ted: Oh, God.\n",
      "Mr Druthers: She's really going through with this. So that's it. It's over.\n",
      "Ted: There is no easy way to say this, but...\n",
      "Mr Druthers: She's giving me the remains of Wolfie? My dog is dead? Oh, my God. I can't believe this. She always played too rough with him.\n",
      "Ted: Believe me, there is no easy way to say this...\n",
      "Men (singing): # Happy birthday to you... #\n",
      "Ted: You've got to be kidding me!\n",
      "Mr Druthers: Guys, you have no idea how much this means to me right now.\n",
      "Ted: Wait, his birthday was yesterday!\n",
      "Man: Yeah, but a bunch of us were up at the conference in Montreal, so we thought...\n",
      "Ted: No! No birthday! No! I got something to say and I'm gonna get it out. Hammond, listen to me. I am sorry that your dog died, and that your wife is divorcing you and that... your life is falling apart and that these guys missed your birthday. And there is no easy way to say... What are you doing? What's going on?\n",
      "Mr Druthers: Oh, God...\n",
      "Ted: Oh, come on, you're not going to pull that, are you? Oh! Look, yeah, right. Now we're falling onto the ground. Well, nice try, but guess what? You're fired! You're fired, you get it? You hear me? You're gone! You're fired! (Mr Druthers is taken on a stretcher with an oxygen mask on his face.) In my defense, I think we all suspected Hammond might have been faking. On the plus side, the EMTs seem to think he's going to be just fine and, as you saw, they did admit that I did not cause the heart attack, even if they said it a bit begrudgingly.\n",
      "Ted (voix off): And there it was, rock bottom: They all hated me. But just when all seemed lost, I had the greatest idea of my entire career.\n",
      "Man: Margarita Fridays--great idea, boss.\n",
      "Lily is still painting\n",
      "Lily: Okay, it's done. I'm gonna step out, so you can admire it.\n",
      "Barney: Thank you very much, Lily.\n",
      "Lily steps out of the room.\n",
      "Lily: Marshall, do you have the money?\n",
      "Marshall: Yeah.\n",
      "Lily: Let's get out of here!\n",
      "Ted (voix off): Kids, I told you stories about all the big holidays - Christmas... Halloween... Thanksgiving... but one holiday was always my favorite-- Super Bowl Sunday. And there was one Super Bowl back in 2007 that I will never forget.\n",
      "They're all at Mclaren's\n",
      "Ted: Marshall, you're on beer detail. Lily, you're making the bean dip. Uh, Robin, you're on chips and pretzels, and Barney, I'm giving you nothing to do so you can just focus on controlling your gambling problem.\n",
      "Barney: \"Problem.\" Oh, poor Superman, he should really do something about his flying problem. It's not a problem if you're awesome at it.\n",
      "Ted: And I will be going to Quinn's to pick up the world's greatest food, the Super Bowl Hot Wings Platter.\n",
      "Marshall: If I were a chicken, I'd go cannibal for those bad boys. Just eat my own damn wing off. I don't care. I'm crazy like that.\n",
      "The waitress: Here's the info for tomorrow night.\n",
      "Ted: What's tomorrow night?\n",
      "The waitress: Oh, God, you didn't hear? Mark died.\n",
      "Lily: Oh, my God.\n",
      "Marshall: Oh, my gosh.\n",
      "The waitress: The funeral's tomorrow at 6:00, and I know it would have meant a lot to Mark if you came. You guys were his favorite customers.\n",
      "All: Stay strong. We're so sorry. (the waitress leaves)\n",
      "Ted: Who was Mark?\n",
      "Marshall: No idea.\n",
      "Barney: Not a clue.\n",
      "Lily: Well, I guess we should go, right?\n",
      "Marshall: Wait... tomorrow night at 6:00, that's the Super Bowl.\n",
      "Ted: Okay, I feel terrible, but the truth is we didn't know Mike.\n",
      "Lily: Mark.\n",
      "Ted: Mark, and as long as we send flowers, I can't think of any reason we'd have to Carl (at the bar): Get out of here! I never want to see your face in this bar again! This soulless b*st*rd just told me he can't come to Mark's funeral because he wants to watch the Super Bowl. Could you believe that? You guys are coming, right?\n",
      "All: Yes... Wouldn't miss for the world.\n",
      "CREDITS\n",
      "At the apartment they're preparing for the funeral.\n",
      "Ted: Okay, here's the plan: record the game, go to the funeral, pay our respects to Matt...\n",
      "Lily: Mark.\n",
      "Ted: Mark, and start watching only an hour late.\n",
      "Marshall: Okay, that's great, but just to make sure it records, maybe we should bow our heads and say a quiet prayer to the TiVo gods.\n",
      "Ted: Almighty TiVo, we thank you for all the gifts you have given us: the power to freeze live TV to go take a leak is nothing short of Godlike. Let's not forget fast-forwarding through commercials. It seems greedy to ask anything more from you, O magic box, but if you malfunction and miss the Super Bowl, we will destroy you in the\n",
      "alley with baseball bats.\n",
      "Marshall: Amen.\n",
      "Ted: Amen.\n",
      "Lily: We are not fast-forwarding through the commercials.\n",
      "Robin: Yeah, they're the best part.\n",
      "Ted: Oh, come on. Remember last year? Who wants to watch a monkey in a coconut bra order a pizza?\n",
      "Robin: Oh, my God. This monkey was so cute.\n",
      "Barney comes into the apartment. He's on the phone.\n",
      "Barney: Seriously, that's the last time I'm gonna call you today. Okay. Good-bye. You didn't hang up either! I know! You hang up! You hang up! My bookie. Great guy.\n",
      "Ted: So let me get this straight. A funeral is the one time you don't suit up?\n",
      "Barney: Have I taught you nothing, Ted?\n",
      "Ted: Virtually.\n",
      "Barney: Suits are full of joy. They're the sartorial equivalent of a baby's smile.\n",
      "Ted: Sartorial\"?\n",
      "Barney: \"Of or pertaining to tailors or their trade.\" Suits are for the living. That's why when it's my time to R.I.P. I'm going out of this world the same way I came into it buck naked. Yeah. It's gonna be awesome. Open bar for the guys, open casket for the ladies. What up?!\n",
      "At the funeral, they all see Mark and remember who he was.\n",
      "Barney: Such a waste.\n",
      "Lily: I know. He was so young.\n",
      "Barney: A hand-stitched, cashmere, double-breasted Dolce & Gabbana. It must be so frightened.\n",
      "Robin: This is going faster than I thought. We'll make an appearance at the bar for the wake, we'll be watching the game by 8:00.\n",
      "They're at the bar for the wake.\n",
      "Carl: And even though we didn't see any whales, Mark and I both said it was the best day of our lives. Okay, I'm getting us another round. And when I come back, everyone else is telling their favorite Mark story.\n",
      "Marshall: Dibs on the one Carl just told.\n",
      "Robin: Okay, I have to be at work exactly one Super Bowl from now.\n",
      "Lily: Oh, let's face it, we're not going to get to watch it. We should just find out the score.\n",
      "Barney: Oh, thank God! I'll find out.\n",
      "Ted: No, no, no, we can't! We have to watch the game together. It's tradition. Think of all the great times we've had watching this game.\n",
      "Flashback. In 2003, they're all watching the Super Bowl.\n",
      "Ted: Second down, everyone drink.\n",
      "Barney: Ted, it's not a drinking game if you drink anytime anything happens.\n",
      "Marshall: Are these chicken wings or angel wings? God, I love these things.\n",
      "Ted: I love you guys. This is so great, all of us watching the Super Bowl together. This is special. We need to do this every year, promise me!\n",
      "Marshall: Calm down, buddy.\n",
      "Lily: Oh, commercials!\n",
      "Ted: Everyone drink!\n",
      "In 2004.\n",
      "Ted: God, this is such a great tradition, all of us watching the game together. How did this start?\n",
      "Marshall: Hey, Barney, I bet you 20 bucks that Casey misses this field goal.\n",
      "Barney: I don't bet. Betting's for suckers.\n",
      "Marshall: Make it like a dollar or something, you know. Who cares? No big deal.\n",
      "Barney: Fine.\n",
      "Marshall: See, there you go, he made it. You win.\n",
      "Barney: Wait. This is mine, just like that? God, that feels good. No, that feels really... good. What else can we bet on?\n",
      "Marshall: Nothing, it's the halftime show.\n",
      "Lily: Oh, so lame. Nobody even pays attention. I mean, Janet Jackson, who cares?\n",
      "In 2006.\n",
      "Ted: God, how cool is Robin?\n",
      "Marshall: I can't believe you invited this girl we've only known for a few months to our sacred day. Now she's gonna be in all the pictures.\n",
      "Barney: Yeah, yeah, whatever. I'll give you the Seahawks plus six points for 500 bucks.\n",
      "Marshall: Are you crazy? Maybe for $50.\n",
      "Barney: $50?! What fun is $50?! Why don't we just bet air?! God, Marshall! Okay, $50.\n",
      "Robin: Hey, I'll take that action. Seahawks, but make it four points and make it a grand. Hey, these wings, are they chicken wings or angel wings? Oh, commercials! Monkey with a coconut bra. Hilarious.\n",
      "End of flashback. Back to the bar.\n",
      "Ted: Look, we always watch the Super Bowl together. So we make a pact to watch it tomorrow at 6:00 and go the next 18 hours without finding out who won.\n",
      "Barney: That's impossible.\n",
      "Ted: I'm not gonna lie to you. It's not gonna be easy. That means no TV, no Internet, no newspapers, nothing. Media blackout. But our tradition lives on. Who's in?\n",
      "Lily: I'm in.\n",
      "Robin: I'm in.\n",
      "Marshall: I'm in.\n",
      "Barney: What the hell, I'm in. High five!\n",
      "Ted: Dude, we're at a wake.\n",
      "Barney: Sorry. Solemn low five.\n",
      "Ted opens the door of his apartment to take the newspaper.\n",
      "Ted (voix off): As the day began, none of us had any idea how hard it would be to go nine hours without hearing the outcome of the Super Bowl. I decided to work from home to avoid contamination by the outside world.\n",
      "Barney comes in\n",
      "Barney: Hey, take this key and swallow it.\n",
      "Ted: What? No.\n",
      "Barney: Come on, Ted, you eat salads. It'll be out by game time.\n",
      "Ted: Lots more, no.\n",
      "Barney: I'm not messing around, Theodore. I've got a lot of money riding on this game. If I don't handcuff myself to this radiator, I'll check the score. Please take the key.\n",
      "Ted: Fine. But only because you didn't think through a bathroom plan and I think that's funny.\n",
      "Robin at work.\n",
      "Ted (voix off): The media blackout was particularly hard on Robin because, well, she was the media.\n",
      "Robin: But unfortunately, the City won't be fixing the unusually large pothole any time soon, so buckle up if you're on the BQE. It's gonna be a bumpy one.\n",
      "Kevin: Like morning commutes needed to get any harder.\n",
      "Man: You're right, Kevin.\n",
      "Kevin: Well, Robin, what do you say? I think it's time to check in with Sid for a sports update.\n",
      "Robin: No!\n",
      "Kevin: What?\n",
      "Robin: No.\n",
      "Kevin: But it's, uh, time for Sports.\n",
      "Robin: No, it's not. It's time for Weather.\n",
      "Kevin: We, we just did Weather.\n",
      "Robin: Well, weather's pretty fickle, it may have changed. What's it doing out there, Lou?\n",
      "Lou: Pretty much the same thing it was two minutes ago. Back to you, Robin.\n",
      "Kevin: Okay, now it's time for Sports.\n",
      "Robin: No! Let's go to Traffic Todd in the Metro News 1 Gridlock Chopper.\n",
      "Kevin: Robin, it's time for Sports! Over to you, Sid.\n",
      "Sid: Thank you, Kevin and Robin. Let's talk about the Super Bowl.\n",
      "Marshall is in Lily's classroom.\n",
      "Ted (voix off): Weeks earlier, Marshall had promised Lily he'd come into her kindergarten class for show-and-tell day.\n",
      "Lily: And he's a little bit double-jointed... And his favorite animal is the Loch Ness monster.\n",
      "Marshall: Lily, how many times...? Nessie is a gentle creature. We're trying to stay away from terms like \"Monster.\"\n",
      "Lily: Well, I think we can all agree, he is much more interesting than Sally's one-eyed goldfish. Three weeks in a row? Come on, Sally. Okay, well, that's all the time we have. Arts and crafts, everybody.\n",
      "Doug: Hey. I'm Doug.\n",
      "Marshall: Oh, hey, I'm Marshall.\n",
      "Doug: Are you going to be staying here for the rest of day?\n",
      "Marshall: Yeah, I'm actually trying to hide out 'cause I don't want to know who won the Super Bowl.\n",
      "Doug:  I know who won.\n",
      "Marshall: Oh, um, that's great, but I really don't want to know, so if you could just keep that to yourself.\n",
      "Doug: How badly do you not want to know?\n",
      "Marshall: Excuse me?\n",
      "Doug: Ten bucks.\n",
      "Marshall: Are you serious?\n",
      "Doug: Just went up to eight.\n",
      "Ted's place. Barney's still tied up to the radiator.\n",
      "Barney: Unlock me, Ted. I've never gone this long without calling my bookie. He worries.\n",
      "Ted: Not until game time.\n",
      "Barney: Where are you going?\n",
      "Ted: Pick up the hot wings.\n",
      "Barney: What? How the hell are you planning on getting in and out of a sports bar without seeing the score? There's TVs everywhere.\n",
      "Ted: Ah, don't worry. I got it all planned out. First of all: I placed duct tape on a pair of sunglasses so I can only see out of two tiny holes. Next, I constructed blinders out of an old cereal box. Top it all off: high-tech noise-reducing headphones I bought when Marshall and Lily first got back together and were doing it a lot. I call it the Sensory Deprivator 5000.\n",
      "Ted walks into a sports bar.\n",
      "Ted: Hello! Uh, my name is Ted Mosby. I'm here to pick up my hot wings. In my hand, you'll find the exact total for the wings plus a generous tip. Please take the cash. Put the wings in my hand and I'll be on my way. Thank you!\n",
      "Back to Metro News One.\n",
      "Sid: And that closes the book on one heck of a Super Bowl. Back to you, Kevin and Robin.\n",
      "Robin has blocked her ears.\n",
      "Kevin: We'll be right back.\n",
      "Man: And we're clear.\n",
      "Robin: I'm sorry.\n",
      "Woman: Um, Robin, is it just me, or were you doing something different there?\n",
      "Robin: I haven't watched the game yet. I'm begging you, for the rest of the newscast there can't be any references to who won the Super Bowl. I mean, change the teleprompter. No team names, nothing specific.\n",
      "Woman: That is crazy. I can't do that.\n",
      "Robin: My friend Mark passed away this week.\n",
      "Woman: Okay, sweety okay. Okay, I'm so sorry.\n",
      "Man: Back in five... four... three...\n",
      "Robin: It's just so hard.\n",
      "At the apartment, Barney's trying to free himself from the radiator. He finally does it and runs to the bathroom. 8 minutes and 23 seconds later Ted comes back with the chicken wings.\n",
      "Ted: Ha! Who's the idiot now?! You said the Sensory Deprivator 5000 was stupid. But it totally worked! (barney leaves and Ted doesn't notice.) I couldn't see or hear anything happening around me. Right?! Right?! (He takes his glasses off) No...!\n",
      "Ted (voix off): And if that weren't bad enough, I was about to have a horrible realization.\n",
      "Ted: Where's the dipping sauce?\n",
      "Marshall is still in lily's classroom. Lily's reading a book.\n",
      "Doug: The team that won, want to know what their name rhymes with?\n",
      "Marshall: Come on, dude. You promised you'd stop if I ate all those crayons. Why are you doing this?\n",
      "Doug: I'm in love with Miss Aldrin.\n",
      "Marshall: Well, you can't have Miss Aldrin, she's mine.\n",
      "Doug drops an object and breaks it.\n",
      "Lily: Okay, now who did this?\n",
      "Marshall: I did.\n",
      "Doug: Does that mean Marshall gets a time-out?\n",
      "Lily: Well, Marshall's a grownup, so...\n",
      "Doug: When one of us breaks something, we get a time-out.\n",
      "Lily: Sorry. Marshall gets a time-out.\n",
      "At Robin's work.\n",
      "Robin: And after the Super Bowl, the mayor of the losing team's city had to pay up, sending the mayor of the winning team's city 15 pounds of a delicacy his of her city is famous for. Better fire up whatever type of grill, steamer or fryer one might use to cook that delicacy, Winning Team's Mayor.\n",
      "Back to lily's classroom.\n",
      "Doug: Hey. Hey.\n",
      "Marshall: I'm not talking to you.\n",
      "Doug: Yes, you are. You'll do whatever I say. Hold your breath.\n",
      "Marshall: I'm not holding my breath.\n",
      "Doug: The winning team was the... (Marshall holds his breath) Now here's how this is going to work: you're going to take me to three R-rated movies a week...\n",
      "Ted (voix off): And then Uncle Marshall got an idea. It was not one he was proud of in retrospect, but desperate times...\n",
      "Marshall takes a glass of water and throwns it on Doug's pants.\n",
      "Marshall: Oh, no. Somebody wet their pants.\n",
      "Doug: No, I didn't.\n",
      "Marshall: Oh, really? Who's everyone gonna believe? I'm a grownup third-year law student at Columbia and you're just a little pants wetter. So now I ask you a question: You want to be able to quietly sneak off to the restroom and dry off or am I gonna have something for show and tell today? Hey, everyone...\n",
      "Doug: Okay, okay. You win.\n",
      "Marshall: I want my money back. And your pudding snack pack.\n",
      "Barney's running on the street.\n",
      "Barney: Sir, who won the Super Bowl?\n",
      "Man: Sorry. I missed the game.\n",
      "Barney: You missed...?! How could he miss...? Excuse me! Who won the Super Bowl?!\n",
      "Man 2: I... don't really follow sports.\n",
      "Barney: Oh, my...! Emmitt Smith! Oh, thank God.\n",
      "Emmitt Smith: Yeah, I get that a lot.\n",
      "Barney: You got to tell me, who won the Super Bowl?\n",
      "Emmitt Smith: The game was last night? You know, once you win two or three of those things, it's kind of like, eh.\n",
      "Barney: But you're Emmitt Smith. You're a football player, it's Super Bowl Sunday. What could possibly be more important than football?!\n",
      "Emmitt Smith: Dance, my friend. Dance.\n",
      "Barney: No...!\n",
      "Barney's on the knees. Ted walks passed him but doesn't see him with his glasses.\n",

      "Barman: Oh! I didn't recognize you.\n",
      "Ted: Yeah, you forgot to give me the dipping sauce! Ah. Yes. This is the one.\n",
      "Ted (voix off): It was 4:00, and so far, all of us had done the impossible. But then, almost simultaneously, things started to go wrong.\n",
      "Robin's finishing the news.\n",
      "Robin: And let's end the day on a happy note. There is a new arrival at the Bronx Zoo. Trish Sanchez has the story.\n",

      "Robin: Mission accomplished.\n",
      "Lily: Didn't find out.\n",
      "Ted: Great. Let's do it. I already fast-forwarded through the four hours of pre-game coverage. So we are ready. (Barney comes in) Barney, I can't even look at you. I don't want any sign of who won.\n",
      "Ted: Don't worry, I'm not going to give anything away. Feel free to start without me. Ah...! Stupid! Stupid! Stupid! So much money! You screwed it up, Barney! You screwed everything up! Stupid! Stupid! Stupid! Okay, let's watch the game.\n",
      "Ted: Barney, what the hell was that? We know who you bet on. Now you've ruined the game for everyone.\n",
      "Lily: Yeah. Thanks a lot, Barney.\n",

      "Robin: I almost got fired today.\n",
      "Barney: I met Emmitt Smith today.\n",
      "Lily: Ooh, you go first.\n",
      "Ted: I tried out the Sensory Deprivator 5000.\n",
      "Lily: Yeah, go ahead, Barney.\n",
      "Barney: Well, I was frantically running down the street trying to find out the score to the game...\n",
      "Ted (voix off): And here's the funny part, as unforgettable as that Super Bowl was, here it is 23 years later and I don't remember who won... Hell, I don't even remember who played. What I do remember is that we drank beer, we ate wings and we watched the Super Bowl together. Because sometimes, even if you know how something's going to end, that doesn't mean you can't enjoy the ride. We even raised a toast to good old Mike. I mean Mark. Matt. Crap! Why do I keep doing that?\n",
      "Ted and Barney are at Mclaren's.\n",
      "Barney: I didn't only lose the game, I lost every single prop bet. Total penalty yardage, number of replay-challenges, coin toss... What are the odds of losing the coin toss?\n",
      "Ted: 50-50, give or take.\n",
      "Barney: Interceptions, field-goals, total sacks, whether or not there'd be a safety, first...\n",
      "Ted (voix off): Kids, never underestimate the power of destiny. Because when you least expect it, the littlest thing can cause a ripple effect that changes your life. Take for instance my trip to Chicago.\n",
      "2007. Robin and Ted are running in a airport.\n",
      "Robin: That security guard was a little bit handsy.\n",
      "Ted: That's funny. She barely touched me. Uh, Gate 23. Come on. If we miss this flight, I will never forgive myself.\n",
      "Ted (voix off): Why was this flight so important? Let's back up a few months to the fall of 2006. I had just sold my first building design and become the youngest project manager in my firm's history. Suddenly I was being headhunted. One firm was even considering me to run their entire New York office. They were flying me in for a final interview at their corporate headquarters in Chicago. It was the opportunity of a lifetime. It was my destiny. There was just one problem.\n",
      "Robin and Ted arrive at the gate.\n",
      "Ted: Hi, wait, two more.\n",
      "Woman: Sorry, you're too late, I already shut the doors.\n",
      "Ted: Well, I'm sure if we pull real hard we can open them.\n",
      "Woman: Hmm, I wish it worked like that, but see, once I close those doors, that's it. Nobody else is allowed down that jet-way. Except for that guy.\n",
      "Ted: Please, if-if I miss this flight, I'll miss the chance to interview for my dream job.\n",
      "Woman: I'm sorry, sir.\n",
      "Robin: His dream job! Didn't you ever have a dream job? Something from when you were a little girl, that was all you wanted to do? I mean, for God's sakes, I'm sure you didn't go to bed at night dreaming about being a... I mean, uh... This is a cool job.\n",
      "Ted: Please, I have to be on this flight.\n",
      "Woman: I'll see what I can do. But it doesn't look good.\n",
      "Ted: Thanks.\n",
      "Robin: Your uniforms are pretty.\n",
      "CREDITS\n",
      "Woman: Okay. They haven't armed the doors yet, so you still have a chance. It's up to the captain now and they're calling us back.\n",
      "Ted: Great, please let us know as soon as you hear anything.\n",
      "Woman: Sure, and for the future, we recommend you arrive at the airport an hour and a half before your flight, not, you know, one minute after.\n",
      "Ted: Normally, I'm incredibly responsible. I just had to go to court this morning and get sentenced. Not that I'm a criminal or anything.\n",
      "Rubin: Yeah, he just jumped a subway turnstile.\n",
      "Woman: You seem to have a lot of problems with the rules of travel. (The phone rings) Hello? Oh, that is great news. It's my mom-- she found her missing earring. Have a seat. I'll call you when I hear something. Where was it?\n",
      "Ted: That thing better have call waiting.\n",
      "Robin: Could you just call the firm and explain what happened?\n",
      "Ted: It's down to three people and I know they need to make their decision today. I sort of feel my not showing up might put me at a disadvantage. I'm so stupid. Why did I have to jump that turnstile?\n",
      "Robin: Hey, don't be so hard on yourself. And isn't this whole thing really Barney's fault?\n",
      "Ted (voix off): She had a point. It was kind of Barney's fault. Let's back up a few months.\n",
      "Flashback. A few months earlier Marshall, Lily, Robin and Ted are at Mclaren's.\n",
      "Robin: Oh, Marshall, how's the broken toe?\n",
      "Marshall: Oh, man, it kills.\n",
      "Lily: You want some aspirin, baby?\n",
      "Marshall: You know I don't believe in pain killers.\n",
      "Ted: Wow, your first broken bone. Kind of kills your whole \"Unbreakable\" theory.\n",
      "Lily: Marshall used to think he was indestructible.\n",
      "Marshall: Well, it added up. I've never broken anything. I've never been sick, and when I need to, I can summon incredible strength. Ted, tell her the story of the really heavy door.\n",
      "Ted: There was a really heavy door. He opened it.\n",
      "Marshall: On one pull.\n",
      "Robin: Well, you must be really bummed, you're not gonna be able to run tomorrow.\n",
      "Marshall: Yeah. It sucks, all that work I put in training for the marathon was a total waste.\n",
      "Barney: Training for a marathon.\n",
      "Marshall: What?\n",
      "Barney: You don't need to train for a marathon. You just run it.\n",
      "Marshall: You're kidding, right?\n",
      "Barney: Not at all. I could run a marathon anytime I wanted to.\n",
      "Marshall: So like tomorrow, you think you could wake up, roll out of bed, and just run the New York City Marathon?\n",
      "Barney: Absolutely.\n",
      "Robin: Barney, we're talking about 42 kilometers.\n",
      "Ted: Thanks, Canada. I'll take it from here. Barney, it's like 26 miles.\n",
      "Barney: Here's how you run a marathon. Step one, you start running. There is no step two.\n",
      "Marshall:\n",
      "Okay, you know what? Prove it. Take my number and run in my place. I will bet you 50 bucks you don't even finish the race.\n",
      "Barney: 50 bucks? Gee, Grandpa, if I win, maybe I can buy myself an ice-cream cone. Make it $10,000.\n",
      "Marshall: You have a gambling problem. You'll bet me 50.\n",
      "Barney: Fine, then no bet. Okay, $50.\n",
      "Ted (voix off): The next morning, as the marathon began, we were focused on Marshall's computer.\n",
      "Marshall: Each runner gets a tracking chip so you can follow them online, see when they pass certain checkpoints. Barney's got mine in his shoe.\n",
      "Robin: Ooh, he's starting!\n",
      "Marshall: This ought to be good. Wow. (48 minutes later) He's already passing the second checkpoint.\n",
      "Lily: This tracking thing is amazing. When we get married, you're getting one of these.\n",
      "53 minutes later...\n",
      "Robin: Wow. Look at his time. It's pretty impressive.\n",
      "Marshall: He's gotta be cheating, okay. He knew we'd check.\n",
      "Ted: Yeah, he'll do anything to win a bet. Remember that time he bet me that Men at Work sang \"Hungry Like the Wolf,\" and when he found out that they didn't, he tried to hire them to?\n",
      "Marshall: Well, it looks like, \"Barney\" should be coming over the Queensboro Bridge and up First Avenue within the next hour or so. But... there is no way that that's really him.\n",
      "Ted, Marshall, Lily and Robin are on the course to see if Barney's running.\n",
      "Marshall: It's really him.\n",
      "A runner takes lily's water.\n",
      "Lily: Hey! That's mine. Yeah, you'd better run!\n",
      "Back to the apartment...\n",
      "Barney: What up, non-finishers?\n",
      "Ted: Wow. Very impressive, Barney.\n",
      "Barney: Right? Yeah, my time would have been like a half an hour better, but I met this total hottie on Mile Seven. We took a quick detour and had our own mini marathon behind a Nathan's. I won.\n",
      "Lily: I'm not sure anyone in that story is a winner.\n",
      "Barney: So where's my 50 bucks?\n",
      "Marshall: All right. I got to admit, you earned this.\n",
      "Barney: Huh? Can't believe they haven't made a coin for this yet. Anyway, I'm heading home. Might go hit the gym.\n",
      "Marshall: Oh, hey, just so you know, uh, all marathon runners get to use the subway for free today.\n",
      "Barney: Wow. You know I really should check out this \"subway.\" Heard so much about it. Wow. Look at me. Slumming it. Maybe I'll make a weekend out of it and I'll call my bridge and tunnel girl tonight.\n",
      "Ted: You're dating a girl from New Jersey?\n",
      "Barney: No.\n",
      "Barney leaves the apartment...\n",
      "Ted (voix off): So Barney did it. He actually finished the marathon. But a little while later... I got an interesting phone call.\n",
      "Ted: Hello?\n",
      "Barney: Ted, it's Barney. Listen to me, I need you to come and pick me up on the subway.\n",
      "Ted: What, what are you talking about?\n",
      "Barney: I was sitting here, totally minding my own business.\n",
      "Flashback. 2 hours earlier, Barney is sitting on the subway next to two girls.\n",
      "Barney: Finisher. Yeah, you know what I mean.\n",
      "Voice: 86th street.\n",
      "Barney stands up but fell. The Subway continues.\n",
      "End of flashback.\n",
      "Barney: My legs don't work. I've already ridden the subway twice end to end. I've seen where it turns around. Ted, you don't ever want to see where the subway turns around.\n",
      "Ted: (to Marshall) Barney's legs won't work. He's riding the subway from end to end because he physically can't get off the train.\n",
      "Marshall: Best 50 bucks I ever spent.\n",
      "Barney: Listen to me, Ted. I'm going to lose you any second. I'm on the fourth car of the six train heading south from Pelham Bay Park in the Bronx. Meet me at the 86th Street station in, like, half an hour?\n",
      "Ted: All right. I'll be right there. Stay where you are.\n",
      "Barney: Ted, Ted.\n",
      "A pregnant woman, on ald lady and a boy in crutches wait for Barney to give up his place.\n",
      "Woman: Oh, come on. You're not even going to give up your seat for him?\n",
      "Barney: I'm sorry. I can't.\n",
      "Old lady: Douche.\n",
      "25 minutes later, Ted arrives at the station.\n",
      "Ted: Barney?!\n",
      "Barney: Ted!\n",
      "Ted jumpes a subway turnstile A policeman catches him.\n",
      "Policeman: Hey!\n",
      "Barney: No...!\n",
      "End of flashbacks. Back to the airport with Robin and Ted.\n",
      "Robin: See? If Barney never tried to run the marathon, you never would have jumped that turnstile, you wouldn't have had that court date today, and we would have made this flight.\n",
      "Ted: You're right. Everything can be traced back to him. Like that rash we all got at Christmas. I have to see what's going on.\n",
      "Woman: So I was able to get you two seats.\n",
      "Ted: Really? That's great!\n",
      "Woman: No, no, not you. I'm talking to my mom about Blue Man Group. Ma, can I call you back?\n",
      "Ted: Okay, what about our flight? Can we get on?\n",
      "Woman: I'm still waiting for... Huh. Looks like your flight left already.\n",
      "Ted: What? No, n-n-n-no, n-no. I have to be in Chicago today.\n",
      "Robin: Well, he never even called you back?\n",
      "Woman: Well, it's typical pilot.They don't call you back at work and they don't call you back after you spend two nights with them at a Radisson in Orlando.\n",
      "Ted (voix off): It turned out there was one other flight that would just barely get me to Chicago on time for my job interview, but it was all the way on the other side of the airport.\n",
      "Robin: What was the name of the airline again?\n",
      "Ted: I think it was something like Flights R' Us.\n",
      "Robin: Was the \"R\" backwards?\n",
      "Ted: God, I hope not.\n",
      "Robin: Geez.\n",
      "Ted: Stupid smart carts. More like dumb carts.\n",
      "Robin: If we miss this flight, it's all Barney's fault.\n",
      "Ted: You know, Barney never would have run the marathon in the first place if Marshall hadn't broken his toe.\n",
      "Robin: Yeah, so? What, you think this is my fault?\n",
      "Ted (voix off): For Marshall, the initial idea to run the marathon came way back in April.\n",
      "April 2006. Marshall and Lily are in the bathroom.\n",
      "Marshall: My pants are starting to feel a little tight.\n",
      "Lily: Oh, that's okay. I love that cute little belly.\n",
      "Marshall: I cannot allow this.\n",
      "Lily: What?\n",
      "Marshall: I am going to run the New York City Marathon.\n",
      "Marshall starts training for the marathon.\n",
      "Lily: \"It is important to load up on carbohydrates two to four hours before a big run. Try a breakfast of a bagel, a banana, oatmeal, strawberries and some orange juice.\" Here you go, Marshmallow. Just like the book said.\n",
      "Marshall: Yeah, but from now on, I'm eating all of my breakfast runner-style. Liquids are digested faster. That way, no energy is wasted, and it's all about the run.\n",
      "Lily: \"Don't forget to give yourself plenty of positive reinforcement.\"\n",
      "Marshall: This is gonna be your best run yet. You're going to accomplish all of your goals. You are a robot sent from the future to win the marathon! You are... Marshall. You are... Marshall. You are Marshall! Yeah!\n",
      "Lily: \"Chafing or blisters can occur in a number of areas, including the feet, armpits, or even the nipples. Try using some petroleum jelly on the affected areas.\"\n",
      "Marshall comes into the apartment scratching himself and goes to the bathroom.\n",
      "Marshall: Oh, gosh! Dude, you are a terrific runner. Tomorrow you're gonna run and finish the New York City Marathon! You're the best. You look good. Nobody does it better than you.\n",
      "Robin comes in the bathroom behind Marshall.\n",
      "Robin: Marshall? Oh, my God!\n",
      "End of flashback. Back to the airport...\n",
      "Ted: So, yes, it was your fault. I mean, if you don't show up at the apartment in the middle of the day, Marshall doesn't break his toe, Barney doesn't run in his place, I don't jump the turnstile and get a court date, and we make our flight in plenty of time! (Ted fells) And I don't fall down and bite my tongue at the airport.\n",
      "Robin: That really wasn't my fault. I wouldn't have walked in on\n",
      "Marshall if it weren't for Lily. Hey, think about it.\n",
      "Flasback. Ted and Robin eat while walking on the street.\n",
      "Robin: Hey, what's going on here?\n",
      "Ted: Oh, looks like they're camping out for something.\n",
      "Robin: Yeah, but for what?\n",
      "Ted: I don't know. Usually there's a Stormtrooper or Klingon in line to give you some indication. \"Annual wedding dress blowout. Designer sample dresses up to 90% off. Doors open tomorrow, 8:00 a.m.\"\n",
      "Robin: Oh, my God. Can you believe what some nut bags will do to save a few bucks?\n",
      "Barney, Ted, Lily and Robin are at Mclaren's.\n",
      "Lily: We have to camp out.\n",
      "Robin: Are you serious?\n",
      "Lily: You don't understand. This is an amazing sale. I've heard about it before, but I never knew where it was. We'll have a wedding dress campout. It'll be fun.\n",
      "Barney:  I can't go. I've got this thing.\n",
      "Lily: What thing?\n",
      "Barney: A pen1s.\n",
      "Lily and Robin arrive at the wedding dress shop.\n",
      "Robin: This is the place.\n",
      "Lily: Oh, wow. Badgley Mischka! Melissa Sweet! Vera Wang! Oh, Robin, do you have any idea what you guys stumbled onto here?\n",
      "Robin: You said wang.\n",
      "Lily: Oh, this reminds me of the ticket line to Lilith Fair, 1998. Only fewer mullets.\n",
      "Robin: You should feel good. You're only, like, the tenth craziest bride in New York.\n",
      "Lily: Ooh, this is comfy. We might actually be able to sleep.\n",
      "On alarm starts beeping.\n",
      "Robin: That's kind of annoying.\n",
      "Lily: Well, I'm sure somebody will be out here to turn it off any minute. (5 hours later) I don't think I can take this. Every time it turns off, I think, oh, maybe it won't turn on again, but then it does. Why does it, Robin? Why does it keep turning on?\n",
      "Robin: It's gonna be okay, sweetie. Why... Why don't we make a game out of it, okay? Why don't we sing along?\n",
      "3 hours later, the alarm didnt' turned off.\n",
      "Lily: If we get through this, I swear I'm gonna live my life differently.\n",
      "Robin: I just want to tell my parents I love them one more time.\n",
      "A man comes and shut down the alarm.\n",
      "Man: Morning, ladies.\n",
      "Lily: It's him. It's the car guy!\n",
      "Robin: Get out of here!\n",
      "All women throw things at him.\n",
      "Ted (voix off): The next morning, Robin was too tired to go all the way back to Brooklyn, so while I was at work, she went to crash at my apartment for a couple hours, and that's when...\n",
      "Marshall: Nobody does it better than you.\n",
      "Robin: Marshall?! Oh, my God! (Marshall falls)\n",
      "End of flashback. At the airport.\n",
      "Robin: So if Lily hadn't dragged me down to the wedding dress store, we would have made the first flight.\n",
      "Ted: Oh, thank God. The doors are still open. We made it. Hi. Please. We really need to get on this flight.\n",
      "Man: Oh, my God! You're that reporter from Metro News 1.\n",
      "Robin: Yes, yes, I am. I can't believe you recognized me.\n",
      "Man: You did that story on the giant pizzas?\n",
      "Ted: Would you check to see if you have any more seats?\n",
      "Man: One moment, sir. Were those pizzas real? Come on, were they?\n",
      "Ted: Robin...\n",
      "Robin:  One second, Ted. Um, you know, a lot of people ask me that. The truth is,\n",
      "the pizzas were real. - Calzones. Trick photography.\n",
      "Man:  I knew it!\n",
      "Robin: God, it is so nice to meet a fan! And I would be a fan of your work if you could get us two seats on that next flight.\n",
      "Man: Well, the, uh, flight attendants are just finishing up their final seat count. Let me see what I can find out.\n",
      "Ted: Would it help if I got on and gave an impassioned speech about my destiny?\n",
      "Man: I think it might hurt. This is such a nightmare.\n",
      "Robin: Okay, so we agree? This goes back to Lily wanting to camp out for a wedding dress?\n",
      "Ted: No. Wait. It goes back further. Remember why we were eating hot dogs on the East Side?\n",
      "Flashback. Ted is in the subway.\n",
      "Ted: 1939?! This penny's from 1939! (at the bar with Robin) A 67-year-old penny. Do you realize this penny was minted during World War II?\n",
      "Robin: Oh, so was my grandfather, but that doesn't make him interesting.\n",
      "Ted: Look, I know a little something about coins, and this baby is worth something to a collector.\n",
      "Robin: No, it's not.\n",
      "Ted: Yes, it is! You know what? I'm gonna take you out to dinner with the money I get for this little guy.\n",
      "Ted( voix off): And that's exactly what I did.\n",
      "They're on the street.\n",
      "Robin: You're lucky there's still a place that serves anything for a dollar fifty.\n",
      "Ted: Hey, that's 150 times its original value. Actually, the meal was only $1.49. 1984.\n",
      "Robin: Hey, in 50 years, we can get dinner again.\n",
      "Ted: How dare you.\n",
      "Robin: Hey, what's going on?\n",
      "Ted: I don't know. Looks like they're camping out for something.\n",
      "Robin: Yeah, but for what?\n",
      "End of flashback. Back to the airport.\n",
      "Ted: It was me. I started this. If I hadn't picked up that penny, we wouldn't have gone to get hot dogs all the way across town.\n",
      "Robin: And we wouldn't have seen that wedding dress store, Lily wouldn't have wanted to camp out there, and I wouldn't have needed a nap at your apartment the next day.\n",
      "Ted: Marshall wouldn't have broken his toe. Barney wouldn't have run the marathon. I wouldn't have jumped that turnstile, gotten arrested, had that court date...\n",
      "Robin: And we would have made our flight. I don't think we can go back any further than that unless you know who dropped the penny.\n",
      "Ted: I wish I did. Though that person's already been punished enough, losing a sweet penny like that.\n",
      "Man: Uh, sir?\n",
      "Ted: Oh, please tell me you have some good news.\n",
      "Man: Uh, I'm afraid not. There are no extra seats on the plane. I'm sorry.\n",
      "Robin: All, right, well, thanks for trying.\n",
      "Ted: I can't believe this. That's it, it's over.\n",
      "Robin: Ted, come on. Your destiny just wasn't to make it to Chicago today. Anyway, if that firm really wants you, they'll reschedule.\n",
      "Ted (voix off): But that's not what happened. They didn't reschedule. They hired someone else. And as it turned out, three months later, that guy ended up having to relocate to Chicago. Kids, funny thing about destiny, I thought I was destined to get that job. But I was wrong. My destiny was to stay in New York. Because if I hadn't, I never would have met your mother.\n",
      "Ted (voix off): Kids, the key to a good relationship is communication. You need to talk.\n",
      "Ted and Robin are et the bar.\n",
      "Robin: How about Mimi's?\n",
      "Ted: Nah, I don't really feel like Mimi's.\n",
      "Robin: Well, I'm hungry. Let's just pick a place and go.\n",
      "Ted: Oh, you know where we should go? Cynthia's. You love that place, remember what a great time we had the last time we were there?\n",
      "Robin: We did?\n",
      "Ted: Yeah, yeah. We had that crazy waiter who kept going, \"You two should get married! You two should get married!\"\n",
      "Ted (voix off): It's also important to know when to stop talking.\n",
      "Ted: Come on. Then we stepped outside. It was raining. It was so romantic? How can you not remember this?\n",
      "Robin: Because it wasn't me.\n",
      "Ted: Oh, right! It was... my sister.\n",
      "Ted (voix off): You see, by the time you've hit your late 20s, you've dated a few people, but when you're in a relationship, it's common courtesy to pretend that you haven't.\n",
      "Ted and Robin are at the apartment.\n",
      "Ted: Oh, my God, Van Helsing is on. Remember when we went to see it? We sat in the back row.\n",
      "Robin: I've never seen Van Helsing.\n",
      "Ted:  That's right. I saw it with my sister.\n",
      "Robin: My boss just got back from Maui. He said it was really romantic.\n",
      "Ted: Oh, it's so romantic.\n",
      "Robin: When were you in Maui?\n",
      "Ted: I... went... with my sister.\n",
      "Robin: With my sister. Why do you always say that? Look, we're not 16. We've both dated other people. It's silly to try to act like we didn't.\n",
      "Ted: You're right. We should just be honest.\n",
      "Robin: Totally.\n",

      "Ted: What? You said...\n",
      "Robin: God, that is so insensitive.\n",

      "Marshall: Okay, so you have to have s*x with one. Either classic mermaid; bottom half fish, top half human, or inverted mermaid, top half fish, bottom half human. Go!\n",
      "Barney: I don't know. Is she fat?\n",
      "Marshall: Yeah, but it's a fish, so it's the good kind of fat.\n",
      "Lily: Hot off the presses!\n",
      "Barney: I-I don't take flyers.\n",
      "Marshall: You took one two seconds before you walked in here.\n",
      "Barney: That's different. It was for a strip club. Two bucks off wings. How much is your flyer going to save me on wings?\n",
      "Lily: Fine. It's a flyer from my play.\n",
      "Barney: Oh, Lily, I'd love to, but we're not in college and I'm not trying to sleep with you. So anyway, this mermaid...\n",
      "Marshall: Hey, Lily's friend asked her to be in this play, and it's gonna be really good.\n",
      "Barney: Lily, I love you, but we're too old for this. Asking someone to come see your play is like asking someone for a ride to the airport or to crash on your couch or to help you move. Call a cab, book a room, hire some movers and repeat after me: Friends don't let friends come see their crappy play.\n",
      "Ted: Okay, first of all, I've thought about it and top half fish. Second of all, we need you guys to decide something for us.\n",
      "Barney: Yes, you should break up.\n",

      "Ted: What are you talking about? It's yours.\n",

      "Robin: So, in other words, some girl you went out with.\n",
      "Ted: Um... I love you.\n",
      "Robin: Disgusting. You let me put on the same moisturizer as one of your exes?\n",
      "End flashback.\n",
      "Lily: It was probably Carla's. Her face was a train wreck.\n",

      "Flashback.\n",
      "Robin: Why is that still in your apartment?\n",
      "Ted: I don't know. I just never threw it out.\n",
      "Robin: Well, why not? Do you still have feelings for this girl?\n",
      "Ted: Yeah. I'm madly in love with her, and the only way I can deal with it is by holding onto a three-dollar tube of lotion.\n",
      "Robin: Not three dollars! Try 14.\n",
      "Ted: Why is this such a big deal?\n",
      "Robin: Because I don't want to use some whore's moisturizer!\n",
      "Ted: Whoa, she wasn't a whore.\n",
      "Robin: Well, she's leaving expensive lotions all over town. It sounds like a whore to me. What else do you have from old girlfriends just lying around?\n",
      "Ted: Nothing. That's it. Well, except for the phone booth. And the lamp by the desk... and the...\n",
      "Robin: No. No! No! Oh, Ted!\n",

      "Lily: Ah, the age-old question: after you break up with someone, what do you do with the stuff?\n",
      "Robin: Question? Ain't no question, girl. Obviously, he's got to get rid of it.\n",
      "Ted: Which is obviously crazy and obviously, I'm not gonna do it.\n",
      "Robin: So we agreed that we would let you guys decide.\n",
      "Ted: Yeah, like we did with Marshall's pants.\n",
      "Barney: Ah, the 2005 landmark case of Lily v. The Joey Buttafuoco Pants.\n",
      "Flashback. Marshall comes in with pants.\n",
      "Marshall: Nice, right?\n",
      "Robin: I'm gonna have to say no. I don't want some 16-year-old\n",
      "girl falling in love with you and then shooting Lily in the face.\n",
      "Lily: Yes!\n",
      "Barney: I vote they can stay. \"Check out the jackass in the parachute pants\" is a good icebreaker.\n",
      "Marshall: Ted. Ted? Ted?\n",
      "Ted: Sorry, buddy, it's a \"no\" for me, too. Oh, and by the way, Bel Biv Devoe called. Even they don't want those pants back.\n",
      "End flashback.\n",
      "Marshall: They were insanely comfortable! They were like pajamas you could wear outside.\n",
      "Barney: Marshall, it's over. We even gave you an appeal and they didn't look any better with combat boots.\n",
      "Lily: All right, well, let's hear the arguments. Ted, you go first.\n",
      "Ted: Okay. The fact that I still have things from ex-girlfriends is no big deal. I mean, when I see the phone booth on the piano, I don't think of Jeannie Radford, I think of the good times I had backpacking through Europe. And when I see the lamp, I don't think of Allison Moses. I remember when I was broke, just out of college, and I really needed a lamp. And when I see that throw pillow, I don't think of Lauren Stein. I think of that weird orange-brown stain and how it got there.\n",
      "Marshall: Creamsicle and turkey gravy, not at the same time.\n",
      "Robin: Well, that's adorable, but from now on, when I walk into the apartment, here is what I will see.\n",
      "The phone booth turns into Ted's ex-girlfriend.\n",
      "Ex-girlfriend 1: I'm Ted's college girlfriend. He made me 12 mix tapes. How many has he made you?\n",
      "The lamp turns into Ted's ex-girlfriend.\n",
      "Ex-girlfriend 2: He calls you \"sweetie pie\"? He called me \"sweetie pie.\"\n",
      "The pillow turns into Ted's ex-girlfriend.\n",
      "Ex-girlfriend 3: I'm stupid, but my rack is bigger than yours.\n",
      "Ted: Really? You can't look at a pillow without seeing my ex-girlfriend-- a pillow!\n",
      "Robin: Yes, Ted, the fact that you still have that pillow is creepy and gross.\n",
      "Ted: You're creepy and gross.\n",
      "Robin: Your mom's creepy and gross.\n",
      "Lily: Order! Order! I got to side with Robin. She's your girlfriend, and if the stuff upsets her, you got to get rid of it.\n",
      "Marshall: I've got to side with Ted. Just 'cause you still have something an ex girlfriend gave you doesn't mean you're holding onto her.\n",
      "Ted: All right, Barney. It all comes down to you.\n",
      "Barney: I side with Robin.\n",
      "Ted: What?\n",
      "Barney: Ted, your place is too cluttered. It's like you're living in a Bennigan's.\n",
      "Robin: Or a Danby's. What, they don't have Danby's in the US? Really? Well, then were do you get Grizzly Paw ice cream sandwiches?\n",
      "Ted: Just stop, sweetie.\n",
      "Ted is getting rid off his ex-girlfriends stuff.\n",
      "Ted (voix off): So I had no choice. I packed up everything I had gotten from ex-girlfriends. It was painful, but not as painful as what I had to endure later that night. New York is famous for its theater, but there's many different levels. There's Broadway, off-Broadway, off-off-Broadway, homeless people screaming in the park, and then below that, the play Aunt Lily was in.\n",
      "Ted, Robin and Barney arrive in the room where Lily's going to play.\n",
      "Robin: Eight flights, of stairs. Who puts a theater up eight flights of stairs? What kind of building is this?\n",
      "Barney: From the smell of it, I'm guessing a urine factory.\n",
      "Ted: Where do you guys want to sit?\n",
      "Barney: I know where I don't want to sit.\n",
      "Marshall (in the front row): Guys, four together!\n",
      "Barney: I brought a bag in case anyone needs to puke.\n",
      "Robin: Come on. It's not gonna be that bad.\n",
      "Barney: No? Okay.\n",
      "The lights turn off and the play starts.\n",
      "Man 1: I... am... Rage!\n",
      "Woman: I... am Greed.\n",
      "Lily: I am Rage... Envy!\n",
      "Barney: I am outta here.\n",
      "Marshall: No, you're not. You have to stay.\n",
      "Lily: This is the face of Consumerism!\n",
      "Marshall: Oh, my God. Ted's part of the play.\n",
      "Man 2: Hello, Greed, Rage...Envy... and Consumerism. I... am your father... America!\n",
      "3 hours later the play is over.\n",
      "Marshall: Oh, baby, that was wonderful!\n",
      "Ted: Totally, I had no idea Greed was the killer.\n",
      "Robin: And when it became a play within a play, I was, like, \"Now we are really cookin'!\"\n",
      "Barney: Wow, Lily, that sucked!\n",
      "Marshall: Barney!\n",
      "Barney: What? It was terrible. I mean, come on. You guys agree, right? Hey, sorry, I'm just being honest 'cause, you know, we're friends.\n",
      "Lily: No, friends make each other feel good. They build each other up and support them. That's what being a good friend is about.\n",
      "Barney: Yeah, if you're a Smurf.\n",
      "Lily: You know if you did a play, I would sit through the whole thing and I would compliment you on it afterwards.\n",
      "Barney: Oh, really? You would?\n",
      "Lily: Yes.\n",
      "Barney: Bad move, Aldrin, bad move.\n",
      "Man: We'll be starting our Q&A with the director-- yours truly-- in five minutes right here. Barney runs out\n",
      "Robin and Ted arrive at Ted's apartment.\n",
      "Robin: Can you believe Barney said that about Lily's play?\n",
      "Ted: I know. He can be really insensitive.\n",
      "Robin: It was pretty bad, though.\n",
      "Ted: Oh, my God, it was so bad.\n",
      "Robin: Oh, my God, you've been robbed!\n",
      "Ted: Nope.\n",
      "Robin: All that stuff was from old girlfriends? Don't you buy anything for yourself?\n",
      "Ted: What can I say? Papa gets swag.\n",
      "Ted (voix off): And that should've been the end of it. But the next day...\n",
      "Ted is walking the dogs with Robin.\n",
      "Ted: You know, at first I was really bummed about getting rid of all my stuff. But seeing how happy it makes you - totally worth it.\n",
      "Robin: Mm, that's kind of how I feel when I begrudgingly have s*x with you when I'm really tired.\n",
      "Ted: Exactly. Sometimes you gotta take one for the team. Well, sit. Sit, yeah. So you never keep anything your ex-boyfriends gave you?\n",
      "Robin: Nope. Well, except for my dogs.\n",
      "At Robin's apartment.\n",
      "Ted: So I had to get rid of everything from my past relationships because you don't keep things from your past relationships except, uh, where are your five dogs from? Oh, that's right: your past relationships.\n",
      "Robin: What's your point, Ted?\n",
      "Ted: Well, you know how you said you come over to my apartment, and all you can see are my ex-girlfriends?\n",
      "Robin: What, so when you look at my dogs, all you see is my ex-boyfriends?\n",
      "Ted: I do now.\n",
      "Robin: That's ridiculous.\n",
      "Ted: I thought you said you got rid of everything your ex-boyfriends gave you. Well, yeah, but not my dogs.\n",
      "Ted: You said everything.\n",
      "Robin: But not living things.\n",
      "Ted: Well, tell that to the rare Bolivian cactus I threw away.\n",
      "Robin: Things with a heartbeat can stay.\n",
      "Ted: Enjoying this?\n",
      "Robin: Pickles, go get your ball. Go get your ball.\n",
      "Ted: Just admit it. It was a little hypocritical of you to make me get rid of all my stuff.\n",
      "Robin: Well, what do you want me to do, Ted? Get rid of my dogs?\n",
      "The dog turns into a man.\n",
      "Man: Guess what position we did it in.\n",
      "Ted: Yes. Yes, I want you to get rid of your dogs.\n",
      "Robin: Um, no.\n",
      "Ted: Really? Well, I say we take it to the group, but I don't like your chances.\n",
      "They're all at the bar.\n",
      "Marshall: She's not getting rid of the dogs.\n",
      "Lily: What's the matter with you?\n",
      "Barney: Even I wouldn't do that.\n",
      "Robin: Yes!\n",
      "Lily: You can ask somebody to get rid of their iguana after it poops in your hair, but not their dog.\n",
      "Marshall: I miss Jebediah.\n",
      "Barney: Oh, I almost forgot. Flyers for my new play.\n",
      "Lily: Very funny.\n",
      "Barney: Oh, it's not a joke. It's my one-man show premiering tomorrow night. And even though it's terrible and excruciatingly long, I expect you all to be there since we're such good friends.\n",
      "Lily: Oh, we'll be there.\n",
      "Barney: Unless, of course, you just want to admit that you were wrong...\n",
      "Lily: Never.\n",
      "Barney: Good. Okay, I gotta go rehearse. Oh, I almost forgot. Bring a poncho; the first three rows get wet.\n",
      "Robin and Ted are in Robin's apartment.\n",
      "Robin: I'm sorry I didn't tell you where the dogs came from.\n",
      "Ted: I'm sorry I asked you to get rid of them. That was ridiculous.\n",
      "Robin: So we're-we're okay?\n",
      "Ted: Yeah, we're great.\n",
      "Ted (voix off): And I thought we were, but just as it did in the seventh act of Aunt Lily's play, Jealousy reared its ugly head.\n",
      "Robin has one of her dog in her knees but Ted sees a man instead.\n",
      "Man: Oh, yeah, that's the spot.\n",
      "Robin and Ted are kissing on the bed when a man (dog) interrupts them.\n",
      "Man: Dude, I gotta pee.\n",
      "Ted: I gotta go.\n",
      "The gang is at Barney's play.\n",
      "Lily: Oh, he's really having trouble dealing with this, huh?\n",
      "Robin: Yeah, he really is. It's got me thinking, maybe I should get rid of my dogs. Might be time to send them to the farm.\n",
      "Lily: You're gonna kill your dogs?!\n",
      "Robin: No! No, no, no, there really is a farm. My aunt has a farm upstate.\n",
      "Lily: Oh, thank God. Aw, you know, if I were five dogs, I'd rather live on a farm than in an apartment in Brooklyn.\n",
      "Robin: Yeah. I could visit them on weekends. My aunt is awfully lonely up there. It's just her and her lover, Betty.\n",
      "Lily: Oh, that's perfect. They love dogs.\n",
      "Robin: \"They\"? What do you mean by \"they\"?\n",
      "Lily: Uh... uh.... uh... People upstate. Oh, look, it's starting. Shh!\n",
      "Marshall: Are you sure you're gonna be okay? I mean, you know that this is gonna be...\n",
      "Lily: I know, but I'm gonna sit through the whole thing, and I'm gonna say something nice about it afterwards. You know why? Because that's what friends do.\n",
      "Barney's play starts.\n",
      "Barney: Moist. Moist. Moist. Moist.\n",
      "Ted (voix off): That was the first 40 minutes of Barney's show.\n",
      "Barney: Moist.\n",
      "Ted (voix off): And then we endured about 20 minutes of this.\n",
      "Barney shoots at Lily with a water gun.\n",
      "Barney: I have to go refill. I'll be back in a moment. Play's not over.\n",
      "Marshall: I never get picked for audience participation.\n",
      "Ted (voix off): And then it just got weird.\n",
      "Barney: Feelings. Inside. Oh, no!\n",
      "Ted (voix off): And when that didn't work...\n",
      "Lily: Okay! Stop! You win. Fine. Barney, I'm sorry I made you come to my show.\n",
      "Barney: Thank you, Lily. Is there anything you'd like to say about my show?\n",
      "Lily: No. No, I have nothing nice to say about your show. You were right, Barney. Let's go to the bar.\n",
      "Barney: Yes! I win! I love winning! Oh, Lily. Oh, Lily, Lily, Lily. I was just getting\n",
      "warmed up, man!\n",
      "Lily: Well, I imagine it was pretty awful, so let's go.\n",
      "Barney: Pretty awful? Pretty awful?! It was a masterpiece of awful. It's genius how bad it is. I kind of wish you guys could see it.\n",
      "Lily: Yeah, well, anyway.\n",
      "Barney: Act two is where I really hit my stride. Spoiler alert: the robot falls in love. Lily: How about this, Barney? How about we stay and-and watch the rest of your show?\n",
      "Barney: It's your funeral. Five, six, one, two.\n",
      "Ted (voix off): So we stayed and let Barney torture us for another hour and a half, 'cause that's what friends do, apparently.\n",

      "Ted: Where've you been? I called you earlier.\n",
      "Robin: I gave my dogs away to my aunt.\n",
      "Ted: You what?\n",
      "Robin: Yeah. Just for a few months as a test run, but... I think it's for the best.\n",
      "Ted: Wow. Oh, man.\n",
      "Robin: Can we go inside?\n",
      "Ted: Uh, no. Uh, let's go to the bar.\n",
      "Robin: Why? What's going on inside?\n",
      "Ted: Um, the floors are gone.\n",
      "Robin: What?\n",
      "Ted: Yeah. I-I sent them out to get, um, fixed. This is a terrible lie. I'm just going to bail.\n",
      "Robin walks into the apartment and Ted brought back all his ex-girlfriends stuff.\n",
      "Ted: I didn't know you were getting rid of the dogs!\n",
      "Robin: You said you threw all that stuff away!\n",
      "Ted (voix off): Kids, this was the worst fight Robin and I ever had. It was one of those fights that last for hours and you start to get woozy and lose track of what you're fighting about. We fought for so long, seasons changed outside the window. Pages of the calendar blew off. It was crazy. But, ultimately, and I couldn't tell you how for the life of me, but somehow we got to here.\n",
      "Robin: We're really doing this?\n",
      "Ted: Yeah.\n",
      "At the bar...\n",

      "Marshall: I can't believe this moment's finally here. One more mile and my little boy turns 200,000.\n",
      "Ted: Your baby Fiero's grown into a really old man Fiero. And just like an old man, he leaks fluid, smells stale, makes weird noises out the back.\n",
      "Marshall: Yeah, he does. Hey, light up those cigars in the glove compartment. They're real Cubans. I got 'em in Chinatown last year just for this moment.\n",
      "Ted: Uh, Marshall, I'm not saying you were definitely ripped off, but these are chopsticks wrapped in napkins.\n",
      "Marshal: What are you talking about?\n",
      "Ted: Whoa, pothole. The car stops.\n",
      "Marshall: What? No. Oh. No. No, no, no. No, there's only.8 miles to go. Come on, buddy. Buddy!\n",
      "Ted: Is it cool if I still light these?\n",
      "CREDITS\n",
      "Ted (voix off): Kids, sometimes life forces us to be someone we didn't want to be. When that happens, we often try to hold on to a little piece of who we were. Maybe a tattoo. Or a piece of jewelry. A tiny souvenir that reminds us, \"This is who I really am.\" Marshall's souvenir was not so tiny, but the more he found himself being pushed toward the corporate world and away from his dream of saving the environment, the tighter he held on to that Fiero.\n",
      "Ted and Marshall are in a garage.\n",
      "Ted: Hey. One good thing: we're off the hook for the folding party today.\n",
      "Marshall: Hey. It's very important to both Lily and me that there be a handmade origami crane in each of our wedding's... I couldn't even get through it. Thank God.\n",
      "Ted: Hey, your car's going to be fine. This is the best auto shop around. Look at this certificate. One of the mechanics here finished a 64-ounce steak.\n",
      "Lily, Robin and Barney arrive at the garage.\n",
      "Lily: Surprise.\n",
      "Robin: We felt bad that you guys were missing the super-fun origami folding party, so... we suggested moving it here.\n",

      "Marshall puts the cups of coffee in the car, then his brothers jump at him to scare him, so Marshall stops the car and because of it all the cups of coffee fall on him and it burns him.\n",
      "End of flashback.\n",
      "Ted: And that is the origin of Marshall's insane \"no food or drinks in the Fiero, not even groceries\" rule.\n",
      "Marshall: It is not insane.\n",
      "Lily: Barney. That's like the third one in a row that you've screwed up.\n",
      "Barney: Well, I'm trying, but it's...\n",
      "Lily: Look. You fold twice to the middle, fold back and forth, pull the ends out, flip over, open the flaps, fold the edges, crease the front, fold in half, fold the wings down, push in the bottom corners, and fold the wings back out. Or would you like one of my kindergartners to show you?\n",
      "Barney: Wait, wait, wait. Wait, I think I've got it.\n",
      "Lily: No. Forget it; the paper's too expensive. You're out.\n",
      "Barney: Aw, nerts.\n",
      "Ted: The food rule is insane. We could have died because of it. Remember the 100K fiasco?\n",
      "Marshall: Ah, the Fiero-asco.\n",
      "Ted: Dude, I told you that doesn't work. It's the 100K fiasco.\n",
      "Robin: What's the 100K fiasco?\n",
      "Marshall: The Fiero-asco?\n",
      "Ted: It was just before winter break our freshman year of college. Marshall and I were roommates, but we weren't really good friends yet.\n",
      "Marshall: I thought Ted was a little bit pretentious.\n",
      "Ted: And Marshall was a total slob.\n",
      "Flashback. College. Marshall comes in the room while Ted's on the bed reading.\n",
      "Marshall: Hey (Marshall throws a sandwich in the trash but misses it) I'm driving my Fiero back over break. I know we see enough of each other as it is, but if you want a ride, I could use the gas money. You live in Ohio, right? I could swing through and pick you up.\n",
      "Ted: All right, first of all, my parents live in Ohio. I live in the moment. Plus, Karen and I haven't seen each other since Thanksgiving. We're both really invested in making this long-distance thing work, so...\n",
      "Marshall: All right, well, call me if you change your mind. My odometer's going to hit 100K.\n",
      "Ted: She'd be so bummed if I left early.\n",
      "In Marshall's car...\n",
      "Ted: It was totally mutual. I mean, Karen brought it up first, but I... it was... it was totally mutual.\n",
      "Marshall: I hear you.\n",
      "Ted: So what's up with you and Lily? Anything serious\n",
      "Marshall: Yeah. Dude, we're college freshmen. I'm not going to get tied down by the first chick I hook up with. Lily's cool, but this bird you'll never chain, you know?\n",
      "Ted(voix off): The next few hours of our drive were classic road trip.\n",
      "Ted: So... this song.\n",
      "Marshall: Oh, it's the best song in the world. It's the only song I like. Just kidding. Tape's been stuck in the player for, like, two years. Better than nothing, though.\n",
      "Ted: Maybe. I am so... sick... of this song.\n",
      "Marshall: Don't worry. It comes around again.\n",
      "Ted: What do you mean?\n",
      "Ted and Marshall singing: Just to be the man who walks 1,000 miles And falls down at your door...\n",
      "Marshall: Yeah, we totally nailed the ending.\n",
      "Ted: That was probably our best one. Hey, you want to play Zitch Dog?\n",
      "Marshall: What?\n",
      "Ted: Uh, it's a car game. Every time you see a dog, you got to be the first one to say, \"Zitch dog.\" I'm pretty good, so...\n",
      "Marshall: Zitch dog.\n",
      "Ted: Well, no, I didn't know we had...we'd started, but... Okay, that's cool. You got the first point.\n",
      "Marshall: Zitch dog.\n",
      "Ted: Zitch dog. Damn it!\n",
      "Ted: Are we still playing? 'Cause I wasn't... I wasn't really...\n",
      "Marshall: 12-nothing.\n",
      "Marshall's sleeping and Ted driving.\n",
      "Ted: Marshall. Marshall.\n",
      "Marshall: Zitch dog, blue Suburban.\n",
      "Ted: Damn it!\n",
      "Marshall: 18-nothing.\n",
      "Ted (voix off): Then Marshall, who was so busy cheating at Zitch Dog, got us totally lost.\n",
      "Marshall: Where the hell are we?!\n",
      "End of flashback. In the garage.\n",
      "Marshall: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold on. I think you skipped something.\n",
      "Barney: Really? Seems impossible.\n",
      "Flashback. Ted's driving the car...\n",
      "Ted: Hey, we got some time. What do you say we get off the highway, take the road less traveled, you know? Robert Frost.\n",
      "Marshall: Doesn't seem like a smart idea.\n",
      "Ted: Too late. I'm taking this exit. Who's not fun enough now, Karen?\n",
      "Marshall: Then we got lost. Where the hell are we?! I'm pulling over.\n",
      "Ted: No, keep driving.\n",
      "Marshall: We're almost out of gas, and we might not even be on a road anymore.\n",
      "Ted: It's below zero out. If we pull over, we could be snowed in for days. Plus, I only have, like, six granola bars and three bottles of water.\n",
      "Marshall: Nah, I threw them out.\n",
      "Ted: What?!\n",
      "Marshall: No food or drink in the Fiero.\n",
      "Ted: No food or drink in the F...? You haven't washed your sheets since... (Voix off): Thus began the longest night of our lives.\n",
      "Marshall: Pretty sure that my foot is frozen solid.\n",
      "Ted: Marshall... there's a very real chance that we're gonna be snowed in here for days. If I die first, do whatever you need to survive. Eat my flesh. Slice me open like a tauntaun, whatever.\n",
      "Marshall: Thanks, Ted. You're a good friend. And if I die first, you just leave my body alone.\n",
      "Ted: What? I just said you could cut me open and crawl inside me.\n",
      "Marshall: Yeah, don't do any of that stuff to me; it skeeves me out.\n",
      "Ted: But... but you're dead, and I'm gonna die if I don't.\n",
      "Marshall: Wasn't an easy decision.\n",
      "Ted: This is all because of your insane no-food rule.\n",
      "Marshall: It's perfectly rational.\n",
      "They start fighting.\n",
      "Ted: Hey! My spectacles! Hey. I know we're low on gas, but can we turn on the heat for just a minute?\n",
      "Marshall: Okay. Dude... I hate to say this... but it's so cold... there's only one way that we're gonna make it through this night.(they're both in the back seat in each other arms) We should've kept driving.\n",
      "Ted: Come on, Marshall.\n",
      "Marshall: No. No. We might die now. I may never see Lily again. I never told anybody this, but... I've known for a long time that I'm gonna marry that girl. If we survive this, someday I'm gonna marry her. I'm sorry about your spectacles.\n",
      "Ted: That's okay. They were decorative. Hey, Marshall.\n",
      "Marshall: Yeah?\n",
      "Ted: Are you still thinking about Lily?\n",
      "Marshall: Yeah.\n",
      "Ted: Please stop.(voix off) And so Marshall and I thought we were gonna die out there in the middle of nowhere. But funny thing...\n",
      "Ted and Marshall are sleeping in the car which is next to a hotel. A man knocks onthe window.\n",
      "Man: Hey. You lovers better just keep on driving.\n",
      "Marshall: Zitch dog!\n",
      "Ted: Damn it!\n",
      "End of flashback. In the garage...\n",
      "Lily: You said you were gonna marry me that long ago? That is so sweet.\n",
      "Ted: That trip is when Marshall and I became best friends.\n",
      "Barney: With privileges, from the sound of it.\n",
      "Mechanic: Eriksen. (Marshall follows the mechanic)\n",
      "Barney: Wow. Looks like he really needs a hug. Ted.\n",
      "Marshall: He said it would be at least 3,000 bucks to make it run again. And even then, there's no guarantee.\n",
      "Ted: Well, it's a pretty old car.\n",
      "Robin: Yeah. You can keep prolonging its life, but it's really mostly machine at this point.\n",
      "Marshall: I know that it's a lot of money, but it's my Fiero, you know? I'm about to graduate and take some sellout corporate law job, and without that Fiero, I'm just another guy in a suit.\n",
      "Barney: How dare you...\n",
      "Robibn: Hey.\n",
      "Marshall: I've been through so much in that car. The suicidal cat.\n",
      "Marshall are kissing in the car when a cat jumps in the roof.\n",
      "Marshall: Hitchhiking Waldo. (a guy is sitting between Barney and Marshall in the car)The homeless guy who broke in through the window and threw up all over the backseat.\n",
      "Robin: Lily, don't. Be strong. Do not go all \"prisoner's dilemma\" on me.\n",
      "Lily: The car's on its deathbed, Robin. I have to clear my conscience.\n",
      "Marshall: Guys, what are you talking about?\n",
      "Lily: Okay. Shortly after we met Robin, she and I were jonesing for Thai food from this one place.\n",
      "Flashback. In Ted's apartment...\n",
      "Robin: An hour and a half delivery. We can't wait that long.\n",
      "Lily: I wish we could take the Fiero, but Marshall has this insane no-food rule.\n",
      "Robin: But Thai food, Lily. Pad Yum Mao. Tom Kai Gah. Thai See Ran.\n",
      "Lily: Oh! You're just saying random syllables, and it still sounds delicious. Okay. Here's what we'll do. We'll drive over, pick it up, have them double-bag it, very carefully drive it back here with the windows open, and he'll never know. (Lily slows down the car and knock down the food). Wow, these brakes are really sensitive. Oh, Marshall is gonna kill me! This and the difference between \"affect\" and \"effect\" are the only two things he's really serious about.\n",
      "Robin: Lily, it's gonna be fine.\n",
      "Lily: No, it's not. Marshall's gonna freak. Oh, God, oh, God. What are we gonna do? Oh, God, oh...!\n",
      "Robin: Shut up! Now, listen to me. The clock is ticking. Okay, first thing, we scoop up all these little pieces of tofu and cabbage. Next, what we need to take care of are the really messy parts-- the pools that have collected. We got to soak that soup up. Last is the smell. We got to cover up that Tom Kah Gai. You mentioned cigars.\n",
      "Lily: There's two in the glove compartment, but he's been saving them.\n",
      "Robin: Hand me those chopsticks. Hey, how about some tunes? Oh, great song.\n",
      "Lily: These cigars aren't helping at all.\n",
      "Robin: Yeah. This was a terrible idea.\n",
      "Lily: Now it just smells like a homeless guy threw up in here. End of flasback.\n",
      "Marshall: The broken windows?\n",
      "Lily: We had to make it look realistic.\n",
      "Marshall: Why did you break two of them?\n",
      "Robin: It looked like fun when she did it. So I wanted to try.\n",
      "Marshall: Can't believe this whole time it was you guys. I've been blaming really tanned dancing leotard guy.\n",
      "Lily: Marshall, I'm so sorry, but sharing that secret-- that's when Robin and I became best friends.\n",
      "Mechanic: Wow. What a special car. So, can I crush it into a little cube yet?\n",
      "Marshall: I don't know. I don't know. I don't know.\n",
      "Barney: Come on, Marshall. This is your Fiero. You know the rightthing to do here.\n",
      "Robin: Wow, Barney, why do you love that car so much?\n",
      "Barney: Love it? Hold on a second. Love it? I hate it!\n",
      "Lily: What? Why?\n",
      "Barney: Why? Why? Why?! Why?!\n",
      "Ted: Let me tell it. It was last year during the transit strike.\n",
      "Flasback. Barney comes into Ted's apartment.\n",
      "Ted: Hey.\n",
      "Barney: Hey. Uh, is Marshall around? I have a massage in Queens in half an hour. I need a ride.\n",
      "Ted: Uh, no, he's at the library all day. Just take the keys.\n",
      "Barney: Hey! Why don't you drive me? It'll be like a total road trip.\n",
      "Ted: To Queens?\n",
      "Barney: Yeah, we'll get, we'll get beef jerky, Triscuits.\n",
      "Ted:Uh, actually I have a lot of work to do, so.\n",
      "Barney: Okay. Well, anyway, I'll cancel. See you later.\n",
      "Ted: Wait! You know how to drive, right?\n",
      "Barney: What, of course I know how to drive. I love driving. Hitting the road. Cruising the lanes. And braking. Honking. Love it. Except for lady drivers. Don't get me started on lady drivers.\n",
      "Ted: Which pedal's the gas?\n",
      "Barney: Trick question.\n",
      "Ted: No, it's not\n",
      "Barney: Yes, it is.\n",
      "Ted: No, it's not.\n",
      "Barney: Middle, left, right? I never learned how to drive! I grew up in the city. I never had a chance.\n",
      "Ted: Well, guess what? You're getting your chance. Because I'm going to teach you. Barney Stinson, buckle up.\n",
      "Barney's driving and Ted's teaching him.\n",
      "Barney: This isn't right. God never meant for us to travel at such breakneck speeds.\n",
      "Ted: Relax. You're doing great. Ignore the old lady on the rascal; this isn't a race.\n",
      "Barney: Dude, a dog.\n",
      "Ted: Zitch dogs, this. Or nothing.\n",
      "Barney: What do I do? Tell me what to do, Ted.\n",
      "Ted: Step on the brakes. Sometime in the next 20 minutes.\n",
      "Barney: Which? Which one's the break again?\n",
      "Ted: The left one.\n",
      "Barney: Left. Oh, man, left. I'm totally blanking.\n",
      "Ted: Make the Ls\n",
      ".Barney: Oh, we're not going to make it.\n",
      "Ted: Why did you just turn on the radio?\n",
      "Barney: I don't know why I turned on the radio! We're going to die. Tell me what to do, Ted.\n",
      "Ted: Relax. You're being crazy.\n",
      "Barney: Help me, Ted! I'm being serious.\n",
      "Ted: Stop, drop and roll. Screaming is fun! Screaming is fun!\n",
      "Barney: I can't move. I can't... I can't feel my... Wait. Wait. We're okay.\n",
      "Ted: We're okay.\n",
      "Barney: We're okay. It's a miracle, Ted!\n",
      "End of flaxhback.\n",
      "Robin: Wow. Sounds like you had some accident in that car.\n",
      "Ted: Actually, he had two accidents if you add the fact that he...\n",
      "Barney: ummina-hummina-hummina-hummina ummina-hummina-hummina hummina. I shouldn't even be here, thanks to that deathtrap. But fate... fate gave me a second chance. And helped me realize that our days on this planet are too few to squander. So I decided from that moment on to continue living life to its fullest.\n",
      "Lily: So you made a life-changing decision to not change your life at all.\n",
      "Barney: True story.\n",
      "Marshall: Guys. This Fiero's meant a lot to all of us. Friendships were made. Adventures had. Horrors faced. That's why we have to get rid of it.\n",
      "Barney: Yes!\n",
      "Ted and Robin: What?\n",
      "Marshall: It's lived a great life and it deserves to die with dignity.Ted: But 200,000...\n",
      "Marshall: But that's life. You know? You never end up where you thought you wanted to be. I'm not helping the environment. Ted's not a philosopher. Lily's not not a world-famous artist. Barney's never driven more than ten miles an hour. Robin, I'm sure, has also experience disappointment in her life. Maybe? And my Fiero's not a Fiero that went 200,000 miles. It's okay. You know? Those are old dreams. We'll get a new car and we'll fill that one up with new memories. And that'll be the car we had when we were first married. When we owned our first house. Maybe even the first car our four kids remember.\n",
      "Lily: That's so sweet. The first car our two kids remember.\n",
      "Marshall: I would like to say good-bye. Marshall is in the car and the other are around it. Marshall taps the dashboard and the cassette goes out.\n",
      "Ted: You know what? This Fiero, it's effected all our lives.\n",
      "Marshall: Affected.\n",
      "Ted: That's what I said.\n",
      "Marshall: Just making sure. Got us all a lot of places. I mean maybe it's time we return the favor. This Fiero should have made it to 200,000. So, let's get it out that door. And we'll push it the last.7 miles. It'd do the same for us. Marshall puts the cassette back in and they all start to push.\n",
      "Maechanic: Hey, geniuses. The back wheels are on blocks. That car ain't going anywhere.\n",
      "Marshall: Close enough!\n",
      "All: Close enough!\n",
      "Ted (voix off): And so Marshall said good-bye to his Fiero. And as the car's final gift to us all, the money he got for scrap parts paid our bar tab for the next two nights.\n",
      "At the bar...\n",
      "Marshall: Arrivederci, Fiero! You were the freaking giving tree of cars.Lily: May you rust in peace.\n",
      "Barney: Rot in hell, devil steed.\n",
      "Ted (voix off): And what better friend is there than that?\n",
      "Flashback. Marshall and his brother are in the Fiero.\n",
      "Marshall: Bro. Have you heard this new song? I just got the cassingle.\n",
      "Brother: Put it in.\n",
      "Kids, in the spring of 2007, everything was great between me and Robin.\n",
      "So we decided to try and make it even better.\n",
      "We decided to move in together.\n",
      "So, I can have the moving truck here by 8:00 am.\n",
      "Does that sound good to everybody?\n",
      "By the way, what are you guys doing with Ted's room?\n",
      "'Cause if you need help with the rent, I'll take it.\n",
      "Why would you want to live with us?\n",
      "I don't call what you guys do \"living.\"\n",
      "Here's the deal, I need a room closer to the bar.\n",
      "It takes me exactly 23 minutes to get a girl from the bar back to my apartment.\n",
      "A lot can go wrong in 23 minutes.\n",
      "This is going to be so hot.\n",
      "She's paying.\n",
      "I swear, if he doesn't call me back, I'm going to go through with this.\n",
      "Please hurry, sir.\n",
      "I want to do dirty stuff with you.\n",
      "Stuff I won't let him do.\n",
      "Every red light run is an extra $20.\n",
      "Baby?\n",
      "Oh, no, no, no, no, no. It was all my fault.\n",
      "I am so drunk.\n",
      "When I'm this drunk, I go crazy!\n",
      "I bet you do.\n",
      "Check this out.\n",
      "What up NYPD?\n",
      "So close.\n",
      "See? If I had a room here all I have to do is get them upstairs.\n",
      "Come on, guys. It'll be great!\n",
      "We'll come in after you guys are asleep and I'll be gone before you wake up.\n",
      "So, you get to have s*x and we get to wake some skanky girl up in the morning and kick her out?\n",
      "God, Lily.\n",
      "Some guy just told her that he loved her then pretended to go to the bathroom and never came back you can't make her a cup of coffee?\n",
      "Real nice.\n",
      "I put all your heavy jackets in this box marked \"winter.\"\n",
      "And all your colorful sweaters in this box marked \"Bill Cosby.\"\n",
      "Make fun, but America loved that guy for a reason.\n",
      "Wow!\n",
      "Almost done.\n",
      "Not so fast.\n",
      "Take your sword.\n",
      "Wow.\n",
      "End of an era.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "It's a bummer to break up the set, but you're going to need that sword.\n",
      "It's true... my building is infested with dragons.\n",
      "Looks like our little boy is finally moving out.\n",
      "It seems like just yesterday he was a cute little freshmen.\n",
      "Discovering Reggae and ultimate Frisbee.\n",
      "He did it later than the other kids but we never pushed him.\n",
      "We knew he'd get there.\n",
      "You haven't moved in yet, have you?\n",
      "Good. You guys have to take this quiz.\n",
      "I found it in a magazine.\n",
      "It's called the \"Are you ready to move in together?\" quiz.\n",
      "Well, if it's anything like you're \"Are you wearing panties\" quiz, I'm out.\n",
      "Question one, Ted, \"Do you want to move in with Robin?\"\n",
      "Mm. Yes.\n",
      "Oh, you got the first one wrong.\n",
      "The answer is \"no,\" you secretly want to be single and hang out with your awesome friend Barney.\"\n",
      "Question two.\n",
      "Robin, \"Do you think you can score a hotter guy than Ted?\"\n",
      "Correct. The answer was awkward silence.\n",
      "Question three, \"Did I just make up this quiz to prove a point?\"\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Yes, I did.\n",
      "Really? You mean it's not from Old Yellow Legal Pad Magazine?\n",
      "So? We all agree?\n",
      "We move Ted's stuff back up here?\n",
      "Mm... no. We're still moving in together.\n",
      "Why? This is crazy.\n",
      "Ted you're throwing your life away. This girl is blinding you.\n",
      "With her shiny hair and her boobed shaped boobs.\n",
      "This is bad for you, too, you know.\n",
      "How are you going to feel when he sees you without any makeup?\n",
      "I'm not wearing makeup right now.\n",
      "Holy crap, you're beautiful.\n",
      "All right then, how will you feel when you can't sneak the occasional cigarette?\n",
      "Oh, come on, Robin doesn't smoke.\n",
      "Wait, do you?\n",
      "Of course not. Why?\n",
      "Don't tell me how to live my life!\n",
      "Ted, I can't let you do this.\n",
      "Come on. This is happening.\n",
      "So instead of fighting it why, why don't you just help?\n",
      "You want me to help you?\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Okay, Ted.\n",
      "I'll help you.\n",
      "Can't believe we actually got him to take a box down.\n",
      "Maybe he's finally getting on board.\n",
      "Where's the truck?\n",
      "Where's Barney?\n",
      "Wait for it.\n",
      "I can't believe this! Everything I own in the world is in there.\n",
      "Except for this box of pot lids.\n",
      "And the sword.\n",
      "I'm going to kill him. I swear to God I'm going to kill him!\n",
      "Right. Maybe I'll just hold on to that. For now.\n",
      "Marshall, we live alone.\n",
      "This is so great!\n",
      "We can finally do all the things we always said we wanted to do if we lived alone.\n",
      "Oh, I know what I want to start with.\n",
      "So, here we are, right?\n",
      "Sitting around the apartment naked.\n",
      "Awesome.\n",
      "Yep.\n",
      "It's not as awesome as I thought it would be.\n",
      "My butt itches.\n",
      "I'm cold.\n",
      "I noticed.\n",
      "Yeah, like you're one to talk, Pointy.\n",
      "Barney, I don't know if you got my other 47 messages, but if my stuff isn't here within the hour I'm calling the cops.\n",
      "This is the last time I'm calling you.\n",
      "Because my charger's in the back of the truck.\n",
      "Don't worry, it's Barney. He'll bring the stuff back.\n",
      "No, it's just... I was really looking forward to settling in, you know?\n",
      "Maybe setting up my TV.\n",
      "Watching a movie in bed.\n",
      "What?\n",
      "Do we really want a TV in the bedroom?\n",
      "I thought we did.\n",
      "I'm not sure that we do.\n",
      "Well, where else would we put my TV?\n",
      "We could just put it in our storage unit in the basement.\n",
      "But wouldn't we miss my TV?\n",
      "Would we?\n",
      "Yes, we would.\n",
      "We've had that TV for a long time and we would feel more at home if it were setup in our bedroom.\n",
      "We need wine, don't we?\n",
      "Yes, we do.\n",
      "Should we, um, move this to the bedroom?\n",
      "Why?\n",
      "Ted doesn't live here anymore.\n",
      "We can do it wherever we want.\n",
      "You know what else?\n",
      "We don't have to be quiet anymore.\n",
      "We can be as loud as we want.\n",
      "Okay, I think we need to lay down some ground rules.\n",
      "Just because we can be loud doesn't mean we have to be loud.\n",
      "And although it might turn you on, you screaming, \"I'm the best,\" doesn't do much for me.\n",
      "Well, it's a lot better than yelling, \"Ted's not here,\" over and over again.\n",
      "Well, at least what I said is true.\n",
      "Well, that was unnecessary.\n",
      "Well, since I only have one box I figure I might as well unpack it.\n",
      "Mm, where do you think we should put it?\n",
      "Well, unless you have a separate pot lid room, I was thinking the cupboard.\n",
      "What?\n",
      "Uh, the thing is my kitchen is kind of small.\n",
      "And, um, I already have a bunch of pot lids and mine come with pots, so...\n",
      "You're saying there's no way to make room for the single box of stuff I try to move into our place?\n",
      "Well, why don't you just take it down to the...\n",
      "Do not say storage space.\n",
      "I was going to say Dumpster.\n",
      "Damn it, Robin, this is all I have left in the world--\n",
      "eight pot lids and a sword.\n",
      "Yeah, about the sword.\n",
      "Hello.\n",
      "Put on the suit, Mr. Mosby.\n",
      "Barney, I know it's you. Where's my stuff?\n",
      "It's not me.\n",
      "If you want to see your precious possessions again, put on the suit.\n",
      "What suit?\n",
      "Ding-dong. Oh, what's that? The doorbell.\n",
      "That's the suit I'm talking about.\n",
      "I haven't gotten to the door yet.\n",
      "Oh, okay, let me know when you get there.\n",
      "Okay, I opened it. And there's a suit there.\n",
      "That's the suit I'm talking about.\n",
      "Barney....\n",
      "This isn't Barney.\n",
      "But I hear that guy's awesome.\n",
      "All right. Listen very carefully.\n",
      "You will get your stuff back if you are able to complete a series of challenges.\n",
      "Number one, put on the suit.\n",
      "Number two, meet me at McClaren's in an hour.\n",
      "How will I know who to look for since we've never met?\n",
      "I look like Barney.\n",
      "Oh, hey, Ted.\n",
      "Suit and sneakers.\n",
      "A little Ellen DeGeneres but you pull it off.\n",
      "I don't have any other shoes because you stole them along with everything else I own in the world.\n",
      "Where's the truck, Barney?\n",
      "Barney.\n",
      "People's whose trucks I'm not holding for ransom call me Barney.\n",
      "I think you should call me The Commodore.\n",
      "I'm not calling you...\n",
      "You're not getting your stuff back.\n",
      "Can I please have my stuff back...\n",
      "The Commodore?\n",
      "No.\n",
      "Here's the deal, Ted, you're my bro.\n",
      "And you're about to become a henpecked, beaten down, shell of a man.\n",
      "So tonight, we are going to have one last awesome night together as bros.\n",
      "It's a bro-ing away party.\n",
      "A special bro-casion.\n",
      "A bro-choice rally.\n",
      "Bro-time at the Apollo.\n",
      "Oh, bro me.\n",
      "Well, so what do I have to do?\n",
      "No, it's not what you have to do, it's what you want to do, and you want to have a good time before you go take Fun Ted out back and shoot him.\n",
      "So... first thing on the docket... get me that girl's number.\n",
      "Absolutely not.\n",
      "Mm. That's too bad.\n",
      "Hey, hypothetical question: if I was all your stuff, would I rather be at the bottom of the East River or The Hudson?\n",
      "Hey, look, world's strongest man is on.\n",
      "Ooh, it's the one where Lou Ferrigno pulls the bus from the Partridge family with his teeth.\n",
      "It's the best one. Hey, Ted, get in...\n",
      "We live alone.\n",
      "Yay.\n",
      "Well, I win.\n",
      "You need to give my friend your phone number.\n",
      "Wow, I really didn't think Lou Ferrigno could pull that bus.\n",
      "Are you sure this is live? It looks pretty old.\n",
      "Yeah, that's 'cause the, uh, TV is old.\n",
      "So, I'll, uh, call you tomorrow?\n",
      "Yeah. Um, not too early. I have church.\n",
      "You were impressive, buddy.\n",
      "Nice work. All right, next challenge.\n",
      "No. No next challenge. Look, this is my first night living with Robin.\n",
      "She's probably pissed I'm spending it out with you.\n",
      "This might be our last hurrah, my little friend.\n",
      "Marshall, I am gonna cook you the best dinner of your life.\n",
      "How would you like a... one-egg omelet with some ketchup and film?\n",
      "Guess Ted's the one who did the shopping.\n",
      "Ooh, look, a microwave pizza!\n",
      "Guess the microwave was Ted's, too.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "So were all the towels.\n",
      "Turns out that everything that was useful in this apartment was Ted's.\n",
      "Everything that was a Foghat poster we bought ironically in college was mine.\n",
      "Marshall.\n",
      "Yeah, baby?\n",
      "I miss Ted.\n",
      "Is it too soon to call him?\n",
      "No, we shouldn't.\n",
      "I don't want to interrupt his first night living with Robin.\n",
      "Ha, nice shooting.\n",
      "You know, if we win this one it's free onion rings at the Intergalactic Snack Shack.\n",
      "What a bargain.\n",
      "We only had to spend 20 bucks a game.\n",
      "Admit it, you're having fun.\n",
      "Maybe.\n",
      "I mean, it was pretty funny when that little girl fell over that space barrel.\n",
      "Nice... We win.\n",
      "Oh, walk of shame, walk of game--\n",
      "what up?\n",
      "Okay. Let's go one more.\n",
      "I don't know.\n",
      "You know you want to.\n",
      "All right, let's do it... I just got to call Robin real quick.\n",
      "Oh, so that's what it's gonna be like from now on?\n",
      "No. Okay, okay. You call your old lady and ask permission to have fun.\n",
      "Me, I will be at the Snack Shack eating our victory onion rings Han style.\n",
      "Solo.\n",
      "Hey, Ted.\n",
      "Hey, sweetie listen, I'm really sorry but I'm gonna be pretty late, so don't wait up.\n",
      "Oh, it's totally fine. You do what you got to do.\n",
      "Thanks. You're the best. I love you.\n",
      "I love you, too. Bye.\n",
      "Hey, sorry about that. Thanks for holding.\n",
      "Um, so if you could go ahead and cancel my subscription to Guns and Ammo, that would be great.\n",
      "No, it's a great magazine. Really great.\n",
      "They've printed three of my letters.\n",
      "It's just that my boyfriend is moving in and he kind of doesn't approve of the whole gun thing.\n",
      "A free hand grenade phone?\n",
      "You know what? Let me give you my work address.\n",
      "I did it, baby!\n",
      "I got beer. I got food.\n",
      "We don't need Ted anymore.\n",
      "I am the provider of this apartment now, and I have provided!\n",
      "\"Provode\"? Provided.\n",
      "Anyway, I got us everything we need.\n",
      "Could you toss me the toilet paper?\n",
      "Be right back, baby. Sit tight.\n",
      "Hey, I got to admit, um... I didn't think I would, but, uh...\n",
      "I had a really good time tonight.\n",
      "You're a good friend, Barney.\n",
      "Hey, man, why don't you, uh... why don't you tell me where my truck is.\n",
      "No, I don't think so.\n",
      "Where's my truck?!\n",
      "Do you know why I haven't given you any of your possessions back yet?\n",
      "Uh, because you're Admiral Jerk of the British Royal Douchery?\n",
      "Because you don't want them back.\n",
      "You could've left at any time tonight, but you didn't, Ted.\n",
      "Why is that?\n",
      "Because I didn't want to go back to Robin's without my stuff.\n",
      "False. You know what I think?\n",
      "I think you spent one day with her and it already sucked.\n",
      "I think you didn't like being there, she didn't like having you there and you both realized that you made a huge mistake.\n",
      "And that's why you spent your first night living with Robin out playing laser tag with me.\n",
      "And that's why three seconds ago you didn't call it \"my place\" or \"our place\" or \"home,\" you called it \"Robin's.\"\n",
      "You know what?\n",
      "You can keep my stuff.\n",
      "Hey.\n",
      "Hey, did you get the truck back?\n",
      "No.\n",
      "Why not? What happened?\n",
      "Oh, he pissed me off so much, I left.\n",
      "Anyway, I just wanted to come back here, space out and watch a movie.\n",
      "Do you anything that wasn't made by John Woo?\n",
      "Why, do you?\n",
      "You know, forget the movie. I just want to sit.\n",
      "What?\n",
      "It's just I eat at that table.\n",
      "Fine, I'll take my shoes off.\n",
      "You know, why don't you just throw me down in the storage space where you have room for me.\n",
      "Ted, come on.\n",
      "No, you come on.\n",
      "I had to jump through hoops all night for Barney and then it took me an hour to get home because his place is so far away from the bar.\n",
      "Oh, my God.\n",
      "What?\n",
      "I know where Barney put my truck.\n",
      "Let's go back to my place.\n",
      "I bet you my place is closer.\n",
      "Here we are.\n",
      "You live in the loading dock behind the bar?\n",
      "I don't live here, baby. This is just my ride.\n",
      "No, no, no, no. I'm not getting into any van, I've seen Silence of the Lambs.\n",
      "Oh, my God. We're drinking champagne in the back of a moving van.\n",
      "Why, yes, Sara. Yes, we are.\n",
      "Those other Rockettes who called you slow are crazy.\n",
      "Oh, my God. I knew it. You're kidnapping me.\n",
      "Help! Help!\n",
      "No, no, no, no.\n",
      "I can explain.\n",
      "Hello?\n",
      "Enjoying the ride?\n",
      "Ted? Ted, you let us out of here. You let us out of here this instant!\n",
      "This isn't Ted.\n",
      "But I hear that guy's awesome.\n",
      "So I took Sara home and I took Barney to a bar near his apartment.\n",
      "Apparently, that strategy had never occurred to him.\n",
      "That poor girl must've been so confused.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Well, at least Barney learned a valuable lesson.\n",
      "You do not want to get scissor kicked in the groin by a Rockette.\n",
      "So, uh, I guess we should get you unpacked.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Yeah, I guess we should.\n",
      "Lily... deep within the Amazonian rainforest, there is a type of tree that only grows around the body of an existing tree.\n",
      "It cannot survive without this tree.\n",
      "It is supported... by this tree.\n",
      "Lily, we are that tree.\n",
      "The inside tree or the outside tree?\n",
      "The outside tree.\n",
      "Shouldn't there be three trees?\n",
      "You and I are one tree.\n",
      "Okay, look, Lily, the point is that we grew around Ted and without him, we're slowly dying.\n",
      "What do we do?\n",
      "I think we can marry each other.\n",
      "But we also have to marry Ted.\n",
      "I'll tell you right now, my Dad is not gonna pay for that wedding.\n",
      "Ted!\n",
      "What are you doing here?\n",
      "Robin and I aren't gonna move in together after all.\n",
      "What happened?\n",
      "I thought we decided we were ready?\n",
      "I know.\n",
      "How did we come to that again?\n",
      "I don't remember. We were fighting?\n",
      "It's all so blurry.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "The \"let's move in together\" s*x was pretty amazing.\n",
      "I know.\n",
      "I did that thing with no hands I normally need both to do.\n",
      "You know... I'm really happy with you.\n",
      "I really happy with you. The way things are.\n",
      "Maybe we shouldn't mess with that.\n",
      "I don't know that we should.\n",
      "Hey... I hear the \"let's not move in together\" s*x is pretty incredible.\n",
      "Let's go back to my place.\n",
      "Ooh, thank you.\n",
      "You're welcome.\n",
      "No, thank you.\n",
      "You'll be very happy.\n",
      "Look, I know you guys are really excited about having the place to yourself.\n",
      "Until after the wedding, I mean, if it's not too much of an imposition...\n",
      "God, this feels so right.\n",
      "Never leave us again.\n",
      "Guys, Robin's down in the truck and there's actually a lot of boxes, so maybe we should...\n",
      "Do we have time for this?\n",
      "Ladies and gentlemen, I have in my hand a copy of tonight's Top Ten list.\n",
      "The category: top ten things I would've called my truck...\n",
      "It was never your truck.\n",
      "...if Ted hadn't been a jerk and given it back.\n",
      "It was a rental.\n",
      "Number ten, \"The Winne-Bango.\"\n",
      "Number nine, \"The Pick-Up Truck.\"\n",
      "Number eight, \"The Ford Explore Her.\"\n",
      "Number seven, \"The You Scream Truck.\"\n",
      "You Scream.\n",
      "Number six, \"Feels On Wheels.\" Hello!\n",
      "Number five, \"The Ride Her Truck.\"\n",
      "Number four, \"The 18-Squeeler.\"\n",
      "Number three, \"The Esca-Laid.\"\n",
      "Number two, \"The Slam-Boney.\" and... the number one thing I would've called my truck if Ted hadn't been a jerk and given it back...\n",
      "\"The '69 Chevy.\"\n",
      "It took me a while to figure out but the key to understanding your Uncle Barney is this.\n",
      "When times are hard, it's impossible to keep him around.\n",
      "Like when your aunt Lily and Uncle Marshall were broken up.\n",
      "Hey. What are you guys talking about?\n",
      "Lily.\n",
      "I got to go.\n",
      "But when times are good, it's impossible to get rid of him.\n",
      "What are you guys doing?\n",
      "We just finished planning Marshall's bachelor party.\n",
      "Good, you haven't started yet. Let's talk logistics.\n",
      "Now, have you laid out ground rules with Lily?\n",
      "Where you are or aren't allowed to touch or be touched?\n",
      "Show me on Ted.\n",
      "Actually, we're, uh, we're thinking of skipping the strippers.\n",
      "You... you want to have a party without strippers.\n",
      "This was the worse thing I could have said.\n",
      "You see, uncle Barney loved cooking up bachelor parties.\n",
      "And it was always the same recipe.\n",
      "You start with a slightly cramped hotel suite.\n",
      "Arrange the chairs in a circle...\n",
      "Fill them with your closest friends.\n",
      "Turn the heat up to about 90.\n",
      "Pump in a metric ton of cigar smoke.\n",
      "And then, right in the middle of the room, you throw in a girl.\n",
      "But not a beautiful girl... no, if this girl was ever beautiful, it was two kids, three tattoos and one pesky substance abuse problem ago.\n",
      "Which one of you is Stuart?\n",
      "Please, I really don't want to do this.\n",
      "Shut up, put in your mouth guard.\n",
      "Then she proceeds to do things that demean the groom, herself and really, the entire human race.\n",
      "Disgusting.\n",
      "Ah, horrifying.\n",
      "Classic.\n",
      "Oh, please, please, no, no.\n",
      "I don't want anything like that happening to me.\n",
      "Stuart's still trying to forget that night.\n",
      "It's my bachelor party. We're not having strippers.\n",
      "Oh, he thinks he has a sain it.\n",
      "So, strippers it is!\n",
      "Now, just, uh, tell me where we're going to be and I'll make some calls.\n",
      "Barney, there is...\n",
      "Before you say no, it has attachments.\n",
      "Look, I know you have some stuff planned for Marshall's bachelor party, but he really doesn't want strippers.\n",
      "Yes, he does.\n",
      "Uh, well, he told me he doesn't.\n",
      "Uh, well, he told me he does.\n",
      "When?\n",
      "Every minute of every day as his inner animal thrashes against the cage of his own puritanical upbringing.\n",
      "Or do you guys not like naked girls.\n",
      "Um, we love naked girls.\n",
      "They're one of the best things in the world.\n",
      "It goes... naked girls, democracy, the scene in Every Which Way But Loose where the monkey gives a guy the finger.\n",
      "We just don't like your naked girls.\n",
      "What, my girls aren't hot enough?\n",
      "I mean, all right, fine, the stripper at Stuart's bachelor party was a 15.\n",
      "She was 15?\n",
      "No, a 15. Like in blackjack.\n",
      "As in, not sure whether you'd hit it?\n",
      "Exactly.\n",
      "Nice.\n",
      "This is important to Marshall. So, promise me, no strippers.\n",
      "All right, I promise.\n",
      "I'm serious.\n",
      "So am I. No strippers.\n",
      "Now say it without winking.\n",
      "No strippers.\n",
      "You just winked.\n",
      "No I didn't.\n",
      "So, when the day arrived, we all climbed into a rented Escalade and set out.\n",
      "Now, every bachelor party is usually made up of the same stock characters.\n",
      "You've got the groom... the best man... the guy who speaks only in clichés...\n",
      "Dead man walking!\n",
      "...the guy who disappears at the beginning of the night and doesn't show up again until the end.\n",
      "All right, who's up for a little blackjack before we check in.\n",
      "No, no, no.\n",
      "None for me.\n",
      "See you guys back at the room, then.\n",
      "And, of course, well... Barney.\n",
      "Every bachelor party has a Barney. Oh, what's this?\n",
      "This car has a DVD player? You mean, we could have been watching these pornos the whole time?\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "This one's in HD.\n",
      "This one's in H-double-D. Oh!\n",
      "That same night, aunt Lily was having a wedding shower.\n",
      "And Robin showed up gift in hand.\n",
      "Funny story about that gift.\n",
      "Hey, Barney, check out what I got Lily for her shower.\n",
      "It's kind of racy. Think you can handle it?\n",
      "Uh, I've been in a ten-way. So, yeah.\n",
      "It's kind of see-through.\n",
      "Whoa, ho ho!\n",
      "You weren't kidding! You know when you should give that to her?\n",
      "1850.\n",
      "Robin, it's her bridal shower!\n",
      "All her friends are gonna be there, they're going to be drinking.\n",
      "You need to get her something daring, something outrageous.\n",
      "Well, what do you think I should get her?\n",
      "There's a store on Eighth Avenue that specializes in--\n",
      "how to put this delicately?--\n",
      "uh, battery-powered, adult-\n",
      "recreational fake penises.\n",
      "And so Aunt Robin went to a store on Eighth Avenue, and a battery-powered, adult-recreational...\n",
      "Well, it was something inappropriate. And we're back in.\n",
      "Robin!\n",
      "I'm so glad you're here.\n",
      "Come in, I want you to meet everybody.\n",
      "Robin, this is my Grandma Lois and my Aunt Florence.\n",
      "Oh, lovely to meet you, dear.\n",
      "They put this whole party together.\n",
      "It's different from what I expected, but lovely.\n",
      "Lovely.\n",
      "And oh, look, there are little kids here!\n",
      "Yeah, my cousins.\n",
      "Listen, I, uh, I forgot something somewhere so I'm going to just go...\n",
      "Robin, this is my mom, Janice.\n",
      "Oh, honey. I'm so glad to finally meet you.\n",
      "Me too. I, I've heard so much about you.\n",
      "Me, too. Oh, here. Let me take your gift.\n",
      "Can I guess what it is? Is it a, a, a mini food processor?\n",
      "No.\n",
      "No? Oh.\n",
      "Oh, give me a hint. What color is it?\n",
      "Black.\n",
      "Well, I guess I'm just going to have to wait and see!\n",
      "Oh, great.\n",
      "Robin...\n",
      "this is my Cousin Margaret.\n",
      "Oh, finally, someone our own age!\n",
      "Wait, do I introduce you as \"Cousin Margaret\" or \"Sister Margaret?\"\n",
      "Well, I'm not officially confirmed as a nun until next month and I don't want to tick off the Big Guy, so let's stick with \"Cousin\" for now.\n",
      "God's watching. Excellent!\n",
      "Man, they spent a lot of money on this porno.\n",
      "Whoa-- Morgan Freeman? Man, that guy's in everything.\n",
      "Aw, man, I grabbed the wrong Deep Impact!\n",
      "No, leave it in, it's a good movie.\n",
      "But, dude, there's no s*x in it.\n",
      "Yeah, just like marriage. Huh? Right?\n",
      "Oh, oh, hey, check this out! Don't ask how, but I procured for us five loco-bueno, hand-rolled, highly illegal Cubans.\n",
      "Seriously, you could go to jail for smoking these things.\n",
      "Marriage is like jail! Right, fellas?!\n",
      "But at least in jail, you get to have s*x!\n",
      "But we're not lighting these babies up, till we get to the A.C.\n",
      "A.C.?\n",
      "Um, Atlantic City. Try to keep up, Brad.\n",
      "We're not going to Atlantic City.\n",
      "Just a second, Brad.\n",
      "Hi.\n",
      "Hi.\n",
      "We're still going to Atlantic City, right?\n",
      "Oh, did I not tell you? Yeah, we switched it. We're going to Foxwoods.\n",
      "Foxwoods?\n",
      "But I've got an ipperstray waiting in tlanticaay itycay.\n",
      "What the heck's in Foxwoods?\n",
      "Well, we've got five third row seats to the Popinski-Salazar rematch.\n",
      "They've set aside our very own craps table, and I reserved a private room for us at Connelly's, where the five of us are going to be sharing a 102-ounce steak from a cow that I picked out on the Internet.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Great. The night's ruined.\n",
      "Sorry, Barney. It was an honest mistake.\n",
      "This is going to be great!\n",
      "Meat, violence, throwing money down the toilet.\n",
      "America-- one; every other country-- zero.\n",
      "Thanks, guys.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "You okay, Barney?\n",
      "What can I say, Ted? You won.\n",
      "Hi.\n",
      "You one... sad, pathetic loser.\n",
      "Boys, say hello to Treasure.\n",
      "Hi, Treasure.\n",
      "I can't believe that you did this.\n",
      "I had to.\n",
      "I'm your best man.\n",
      "Ted's my best man.\n",
      "You've yet to make a decision and that's fine.\n",
      "But as your best-man-to-be, it's my job to make sure at your bachelor party you see a woman take her clothes off while dancing to Whitesnake's \"Here I Go Again.\"\n",
      "All right, fine, but... let's make it fast, all right.\n",
      "The fight starts in an hour we don't want to miss it.\n",
      "It's a girl taking her clothes off. How long can it take?\n",
      "It's a bit more complicated than that.\n",
      "I need two grounded sockets, a large sterile pot filled with hot water and you all need to sign these releases.\n",
      "An egg beater! Aw, thank you, Aunt Sylvia!\n",
      "I love that it's cordless.\n",
      "Well, at least I got that part right.\n",
      "All of these gifts are so thoughtful.\n",
      "Lily?\n",
      "I need you to look at me right now and read my mind.\n",
      "Oh, my God! You're hearing me!\n",
      "Yeah!\n",
      "Sorry this party's so boring. What's up?\n",
      "Do not open my gift. See what I'm doing here?\n",
      "I'm looking over at the gift, then back at you, and I'm shaking my head, \"no.\"\n",
      "Gift. You. No.\n",
      "Are you getting that?\n",
      "I totally got it.\n",
      "Here you go.\n",
      "Lily said it was your time of the month.\n",
      "You're welcome.\n",
      "What are you doing?\n",
      "Oh, just, um... rearranging the gifts. The pile looked a bit precarious. So...\n",
      "Oh, don't worry, I'll keep an eye on it.\n",
      "Great. You do that.\n",
      "You're gonna make a damn good nun.\n",
      "As many times as Robin told this story over the years, she would never quite be able to explain the logic of her next move.\n",
      "Is this a strip show or a Kiss concert?\n",
      "Shh! She's starting.\n",
      "Please turn off your cell phones, pagers and sense of shame.\n",
      "All right, boys. Lie back, get comfortable, and enjoy the show.\n",
      "Of course there's no way I'm telling you about her show.\n",
      "So, let's skip ahead a little.\n",
      "Ow!\n",
      "Oh my God, are you all right?\n",
      "No, I am not all right, you idiot. My ankle is broken!\n",
      "Take me to the hospital!\n",
      "Um, actually, we have tickets.\n",
      "You know what? Thanks a lot, Barney.\n",
      "She told you at the beginning of the show not to use the smoke machine when she's on the hippity hop.\n",
      "Now I'm going to have to spend the rest of my bachelor party in a hospital.\n",
      "Well, hey, maybe we'll get to see her X-rays.\n",
      "The ultimate strip show.\n",
      "X-rays. More like triple X-rays.\n",
      "Just stop.\n",
      "Which exit is the hospital?\n",
      "What if she doesn't make it to the hospital?\n",
      "Barney, please calm down.\n",
      "Maybe we should just take her to the desert, bury her and wash our hands of this whole thing!\n",
      "Dude, what is the matter with you?\n",
      "I'm just trying to illustrate to Marshall that as his best man...\n",
      "You're not my best man.\n",
      "As his best man, I would help him bury a hooker in the desert.\n",
      "I'm not a hooker.\n",
      "And you're not my best man.\n",
      "You've ruined my bachelor party.\n",
      "I don't know why you wouldn't just listen to me when I said I didn't want this.\n",
      "Well, the fight started ten minutes ago. Maybe-maybe we should listen.\n",
      "Oh, Doctor, what a fight!\n",
      "That knockout will be talked about for years to come!\n",
      "Anyone lucky enough to be in the arena tonight just witnessed boxing history in the making!\n",
      "Thank you so much, Margaret. I can't believe you carved that crucifix yourself.\n",
      "So talented.\n",
      "Didn't think you could carve.\n",
      "For you. Oh. And this one's from...\n",
      "Grandma Lois.\n",
      "Oh. No, wait, darling.\n",
      "Before you open this, I-I want to say a few words.\n",
      "Okay, something you need to know.\n",
      "Grandma Lois thought she was giving her granddaughter an antique sewing machine.\n",
      "And we're back in.\n",
      "Honey, this handy little device has been in our family for generations.\n",
      "I used it, your great grandmother used it.\n",
      "Now, her mother didn't use this one, but she used one just like it.\n",
      "Of course, back then, they were made out of wood.\n",
      "And, uh, I guess before that, you just had to do it by hand.\n",
      "Would you pass the wine, please?\n",
      "No.\n",
      "Hey, Marshall, while we're here, you may as well go down to the morgue and climb into a drawer, 'cause that's what marriage is like.\n",
      "Can I get an amen?\n",
      "Is everything all right at home, Stuart?\n",
      "No.\n",
      "It's broken.\n",
      "Oh, damn it, this is bad. I really can't lose this job.\n",
      "My daughters are about to start school, and my fiancé, well... ever since he got back from Iraq, pretty much all he does is drink.\n",
      "I think about leaving him, but...\n",
      "I don't want my girls growing up without a dad like I did.\n",
      "I don't want them to know what that's like.\n",
      "So, show time?\n",
      "What is the matter with you?\n",
      "Her ankle's broken.\n",
      "I know for a fact that the second half of her act takes place largely in a seated or supine position.\n",
      "Oh, that's true.\n",
      "Treasure, please, don't worry about the show.\n",
      "Uh, we'd feel bad.\n",
      "What does that mean?\n",
      "No. We just mean, uh, you're off the hook.\n",
      "You don't have to do it.\n",
      "I don't have to do it? Well, guess what?\n",
      "I know I don't have to do it. I do it because I am good at it.\n",
      "Look, I don't need your pity.\n",
      "All I want to do is give you a great show because you're getting married!\n",
      "Is that so much to ask? Is that such a major inconvenience?!\n",
      "Oh, that is wrong.\n",
      "Oh, that's just so wrong.\n",
      "Well, the doctor did say for her to keep it elevated.\n",
      "When I was a girl, my mother taught me and my sister to use it.\n",
      "We used to have contests to see who could finish faster.\n",
      "It was so exciting. The whole family would gather around to watch.\n",
      "And when I was a new bride, this is what kept me buzy all those long nights when your grandfather was in Korea.\n",
      "And speaking of your grandfather, though I don't think he'd care to admit this to any of his army buddies, but... he'd have a go at it every once in a while.\n",
      "And he enjoyed it.\n",
      "Oh, open it up, sweetie.\n",
      "May this give for you as much joy as it's brought me.\n",
      "Grandma, um...\n",
      "Wow.\n",
      "Well, take it out, honey. I want to show you how to use it.\n",
      "Okay, no, no! Don't take it out.\n",
      "Lily, that's not your grandma's gift. It's mine.\n",
      "I panicked, and I switched the cards because I was embarrassed.\n",
      "Well, what is it?\n",
      "It's just like the one Miranda gave to Charlotte on s*x and the City.\n",
      "Oh, I love that show. I always watch it on TBS.\n",
      "Oh, you would. You're such a Samantha!\n",
      "Oh, I'm a Carrie! You're a Samantha!\n",
      "And then the night became a whole new kind of uncomfortable.\n",
      "So where do I get one of these?\n",
      "Mom!\n",
      "Man, what a show, huh?\n",
      "She did some disgusting stuff. Really sticks with you.\n",
      "I may be done eating.\n",
      "Me, too.\n",
      "I mean, like, forever.\n",
      "Me, too.\n",
      "I miss my wife.\n",
      "Hey, let's go around the table and say what our favorite part was.\n",
      "Mine was that thing with the typewriter.\n",
      "I mean, she made some spelling mistakes, but still.\n",
      "Ooh, and you guys were all, \"Barney, put out the cigar!\n",
      "It's a non-smoking room!\" And I was all, \"Hell, no, this is a Cuban!\"\n",
      "Of course, eventually, I did put it out.\n",
      "Did I put it out?\n",
      "I put it out.\n",
      "Did I put it out?\n",
      "I put it out.\n",
      "Did I put it out?\n",
      "It was a small fire, not even big enough to force an evacuation of the hotel, but definitely big enough to get us kicked out, and bring Marshall's bachelor party to an early end.\n",
      "Is that...?\n",
      "It is.\n",
      "Hey, guys.\n",
      "How was the fight?\n",
      "Hey, what are you guys doing here? What happened to the bachelor party?\n",
      "We missed the fight, dinner was ruined, we spent half the night in the hospital, and got kicked out of the hotel.\n",
      "What do you think happened?\n",
      "Barney. Barney.\n",
      "Hey, I was just trying to be a good best man.\n",
      "You know what a best man does, Barney? He does what the groom wants.\n",
      "But all you ever think about is what you want, what's best for you.\n",
      "Best man?\n",
      "I'm not even sure I'm inviting you to the wedding at this point.\n",
      "You don't mean that.\n",
      "Why should I invite you? You don't even want us to get married.\n",
      "That's not true.\n",
      "Lily, don't.\n",
      "What?\n",
      "I'm sorry, Barney.\n",
      "It happened last summer when we were broken up.\n",
      "Hey, what are you guys talking about?\n",
      "Lily.\n",
      "Ah, I got to go.\n",
      "Newark Airport, please.\n",
      "Yeah, yeah, yeah. Barney, what are you doing here?\n",
      "I can't believe it's really you. Come in, have a seat.\n",
      "Do you want some tea? I know the apartment's small, but I don't need much space. Let me show you some of my paintings.\n",
      "I think it's some of my best work ever. Just stop it.\n",
      "Lily, you have to come home. You and Marshall belong together.\n",
      "The two of you have something that most people search their whole lives for and never find.\n",
      "I know you love him, and if you knew what he was going through right now, you wouldn't be here for one more second.\n",
      "I bought you a ticket home.\n",
      "Marshall is one of the best people I know, and it won't be long until someone else realizes that, and you'll lose him forever.\n",
      "I can't stand the thought of that happening, and I cannot keep stealing chicks from him forever.\n",
      "Never, ever tell anyone I was here. I will deny it tooth and nail.\n",
      "This trip never happened.\n",
      "Hey, if you had three hours to kill before your flight, what would you do--\n",
      "Alcatraz or Fisherman's Wharf?\n",
      "You really did that?\n",
      "Marshall, I think Barney's your best man.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Yes, he is.\n",
      "See, Lily? This is why I didn't...\n",
      "Really?\n",
      "Really.\n",
      "Real...\n",
      "In your face, loser!\n",
      "Take it easy, all right. Ted's still my best man, too.\n",
      "You guys are co-best men.\n",
      "Right. Yes, we're both best man.\n",
      "No, um, seriously. You guys are co-best men.\n",
      "Of course.\n",
      "I can't believe you got me this.\n",
      "Oh, I only did it as a joke. I can return it for you you want.\n",
      "Oh, no, it's okay. You don't have to go all the way back down there.\n",
      "I'll, I'll just throw it away.\n",
      "Well, I mean, if you were going to throw it away, maybe I'll take it in case I get invited to another wedding shower.\n",
      "It's a great gag gift.\n",
      "Yeah, it's really funny.\n",
      "You know who would get a kick out of it?\n",
      "Marshall.\n",
      "So, so maybe I'll just hold on to it.\n",
      "I would be embarrassed if Marshall found out that I bought it for you,\n",
      "so I'd better just take it.\n",
      "Ted (2030): When the marriage approched, some weird stuff started happening.\n",
      "Lily: Why does my stomach hurt?\n",
      "Marshall: I'm sorry, baby. I ate a bunch of ice cream earlier today.\n",
      "Lily: Oh, baby, you know we're lactose-intolerant.\n",
      "Tes: Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Are you suggesting that when one of you feels something, the other feels it, too? Oh, God, you guys are so codependent.\n",
      "Lily: No, we're not.\n",
      "Ted: Oh, really? What about the other day?\n",
      "Flashback. Lily and Marshall are in the kitchen.\n",
      "Lily: Oh, I need to get some eggs.\n",
      "Marshall: Oh, I'll come with you.\n",
      "Marshall accompanies Lily up to the refrigerator. End of flashback.\n",
      "Marshall: Just because we like spending time together doesn't mean we're codependent.\n",
      "Barney: Really? Then whatever happened to your plan of spending the last two weeks before your wedding sleeping apart?\n",
      "Marshall: Okay, we decided not to do that because of...\n",
      "Lily: Logistics. Wedding logistics.\n",
      "Marshall: Frickin' logistics, man. They mess everything up.\n",
      "Ted: You didn't do it because you couldn't do it.\n",
      "Marshall: Sure we could.\n",
      "Robin: Then why don't you? You can stay with me.\n",
      "Lily: It would make our wedding night more special.\n",
      "Marshall: Okay, let's do it.\n",
      "Lily: Done.\n",
      "Marshall: I'm gonna go grab a beer.\n",
      "Lily: I'll come with you. No. I'll stay.\n",
      "CREDITS\n",
      "At the apartment, Lily's on the phone. Robin and Ted come in...\n",
      "Lily: Okay, I know. You know? I got to go. Good-bye. My mom's driving me cra....\n",
      "God, you guys are covered in sauce. We'll get to that. Me first. My mom is driving me crazy about the wedding music. The woman takes one cruise to Jamaica, and suddenly, it's \"not a party without steel drums.\" Doesn't everybody know you're not supposed to stress out a bride right before her wedding?! Okay, sauce, go.\n",
      "Ted: Long story. I'll tell you later.\n",
      "Barney: Yeah. It's a dirty story, isn't it? You guys went out to dinner, did it in the kitchen and got caught. Scherbatsky reeks of someone who likes to get caught.\n",
      "Robin: Okay, now I have to wash up for two reasons.\n",
      "Marshall: Oh, you didn't. That's right.\n",
      "Barney: So you and Lily really think you can spend two weeks apart?\n",
      "Marshall: You know what, Barney? Lily and I are a lot less chees than you make us out to be.\n",
      "Lily: Marshmallow, don't forget to pack my night-night tape.\n",
      "Barney: Night-night tape? Did you make a tape of you saying \"night-night\" to her?\n",
      "Marshall: No.\n",
      "Lily: He doesn't say it. He sings it.\n",
      "Barney: Oh, that is so sweet. Why don't you kiss? I love it when two chicks make out.\n",
      "Lily: Damn it. Nobody's bought us anything cool yet off our registry.\n",
      "Barney: What's on there?\n",
      "Lily: Ooh, lots of stuff. Kitchen Aide Artisan Series tilt-head stand mixer...\n",
      "Barney: Retail price $319.99. What else?\n",
      "Lily: Um, the Dyson DC17 Animal vacuum.\n",
      "Barney: Ah, $549.99. A little greedy, don't you think?\n",
      "Marshall: Did you memorize our registry?\n",
      "Barney: No, I'm training.\n",
      "Marshall: Training? For what?\n",
      "Barney: I'm glad you asked. Ted, Robin, get in here! You guys know how it's hard to be friends with me 'cause I'm so awesome?\n",
      "Ted: Yes, it's hard to be friends with you. Go on.\n",
      "Barney: Well, this isn't going to make it any easier. I am going to be on... The Price Is Right.\n",
      "Marshall: No way!\n",
      "Ted: What?!\n",
      "Barney: Yes, in a couple days, Rich Fields is going to call out my name, and I will come on down.\n",
      "Marshall: Whoa, that is so awesome.\n",
      "Robin: Barney, I didn't know you were such a fan of The Price is Right.\n",
      "Barney: Are you kidding? T.P.I.R. is not just an indescribably entertaining hour of television, it's a microcosm of our entire economic system-- a capitalist utopia, where consumers are rewarded for their persistence, market acumen and intrepid spirit. I gaze upon the glory of The Price Is Right, and I see the face of America. And it is divine. Plus, you know, hot chicks on sports cars.\n",
      "Ted (2030): Then Lily headed out to Robin's for her first night away from Marshall.\n",
      "Lily: I'm ready! Lily comes into the livingroom with her wedding dress while Robin singins.)\n",
      "Robin: Ta-da-da-da-da... Wow, Lily, you look so beautiful.\n",
      "Lily: I know! I'm beautiful! I'm a fairy princess! (she raises her arms and the dress falls.) I'm too skinny for my dress!\n",
      "At Ted's apartment...\n",
      "Ted(2030): Meanwhile, I was testing out my best man toast on Marshall.\n",
      "Ted: Here goes. Hello, everyone, I'm Ted Mosby, Marshall's best man. Strong opening, right?\n",
      "Marshall: That's fantastic.\n",
      "Ted: When Marshall graduates this spring, he'll be a lawyer. But did you know that Marshall has a criminal record? That's right, on a road trip up to Cape Cod, Marshall was pulled over for driving by himself in a car pool lane.\n",
      "Flashback. Marshall's in the car and the siren oft he police rings...\n",
      "Marshall: Oh, crap.\n",
      "Lily gets up...\n",
      "Lily: Oh, crap.\n",
      "End of flashback.\n",
      "Marshall: Are you crazy? You cannot tell that story at my wedding. My entire family's gonna be there. My little cousins, my mom, my grandma, my grandpa the minister.\n",
      "Ted: That grandpa died three years ago.\n",
      "Marshall: His favorite grandson is getting married, Ted. I think he can take a day off from haunting the barn to make an appearance.\n",
      "Barney comes into the apartment yelling, then he leaves again and yells diferently.\n",
      "Barney: So which one, \"A\" or \"B\"?\n",
      "Marshall: What was that?\n",
      "Barney: I have to decide how to run to contestant's row when they say, \"Barney Stinson, come on down!\"\n",
      "Ted: Oh, I didn't realize that's what it was. Can you do them again?\n",
      "Barney: Yeah, of course.\n",
      "Barney leaves again, behind him Ted closes the door.\n",
      "Barney: Hey! Very funny. Just for that, when I win all the prizes, the only thing you guys are getting is Rice-A-Roni and Turtle Wax.\n",
      "At Robin's apartment, Lily's on the phone...\n",
      "Lily: It's $300 just to take the bust in? Oh, please, you have to have some sympathy for me. I'm getting married next Saturday, and I'm too skinny for my dress. I lost all this weight without even trying. Hello?\n",
      "Robin: What happened?\n",
      "Lily: She called me a bitch and hung up. Oh, I don't know what to do. I guess I'll just have to pay the $300.\n",
      "Robin: Pay the $300? Lily, are you crazy? This isn't a problem. It's a license to eat. Look, what have you always wanted to eat but didn't because it was too ridicuusly decadent?\n",
      "Lily: Ooh, a Valrhona chocolate soufflée with a raspberry brandy sauce topped with caramelized bananas and hazelnut gelato.\n",
      "Robin: I have Cool Whip and half a bag of Fritos.\n",
      "Lily: Done!\n",
      "At the apartment...\n",
      "Ted: Okay, think you're gonna be happy with my new toast. There's nothing sexual. It's, uh, it's just the story of an important moment in your relationship.\n",
      "Marshall: I'm all ears. Hello, everyone,\n",
      "Ted: I'm Ted Mosby, Marshall's best man.\n",
      "Marshall: Nice.\n",
      "Ted: Right? That's great. Back when we were all freshman and Marshall and Lily were just a few short weeks into their relationship... It was 4:00 in the morning, and I'm not gonna lie, we were a wee bit wasted. We were starving. So I'd gone out to get us some snacks, and when I got back...\n",
      "Flasback. In their college room, Lily and Marshall are sitting on the floor, when Ted comes in with the snacks, Lily doesn't see him.\n",
      "Marshall: I love you.\n",
      "Lily: I love you, too. I know it's soon to say it, but I'm so glad you did.\n",
      "Marshall: Yeah. Ted leaves the room.\n",
      "End of flashback. Ted and Marshall are at the bar.\n",
      "Marshall: So here's what you want to talk about in front of my entire family: drinking, having a girl in my room, eating junk food.\n",
      "Ted: Dude, you're almost 30. Your mom would be mad at you for eating junk food?\n",
      "Marshall: Yeah, Ted, 'cause nutrition's not important. Also, so Lily's never heard that story before. How's she going to react when she finds out the first time I said \"I love you\" to her, I was actually saying it to you and a bag of Funyuns\n",
      "Ted: But who cares? You did love her. And you still do. And you're totally over Funyuns, so it's not weird.\n",
      "They join Robin and Lily at a table.\n",
      "Marshall: Hey, Lil.\n",
      "Lily: Hey.\n",
      "Ted: Hey? That's it?\n",
      "Marshall: What are you talking about?\n",
      "Ted: Well, you guys have been spending the last few nights apart. I figured there'd be a lot of giggling, crying, jumping up and down, and then whatever Lily would do\n",
      "Ted (2030): Now, one thing I remember about the bar menu at McClaren's is that there were no fewer than 11 different deep-fried appetizers. That night, Aunt Lily ordered them all.\n",
      "Barney comes in with the wheel of a bike.\n",
      "Barney: Check it out. Okay, imagine... imagine, if you will, that this is the $1 space on The Price Is Right wheel. Ready? (he turnst he wheel)\n",
      "Marshall: Oh, wow, that was pretty close.\n",
      "Barney: Close? Close?! It's called The Price Is Right, not The Price Is Close! Oh, man, this is bad. If I don't win the spin-off, and I can't get into the Showcase Showdown, everything's ruined! It's all ruined!\n",
      "Ted: What is ruined? Why, why is this such a big deal?\n",
      "Barney: Okay, guys... sit down, I've got to tell you something. The reason I'm going on The Price Is Right is because I've decided that it's time for me to meet my real father.\n",
      "Ted: Your father?\n",
      "Barney: That's right. My father... is Bob Barker.\n",
      "Ted: Your dad... is Bob Barker?\n",
      "Barney: That's right\n",
      "Lily: The host of The Price Is Right, Bob Barker?\n",
      "Barney: That's Pops.\n",
      "Robin: Barney?\n",
      "Bareney: Yes, Robin?\n",
      "Robin: Why in the world do you think Bob Barker is your father?\n",
      "Barney: Uh, because my mother told me he was, that's why.\n",
      "Flashback. Barney's a kid and he's wathing the Price is Right.\n",
      "Barney: Mom, who's my dad? All the other kids at school know who their dad is. Who's mine?\n",
      "Barney's mom: Oh, I don't know. That guy. (she shows him Bob Barker on TV)\n",
      "Barney(in front oft he tv):Look, Dad, I got straight A's!\n",
      "Bareny (dressed as Bob Barker): Hey, Dad, guess who I'm going as for Halloween?\n",
      "Barney (throwing a ball at the TV): Want to play some catch, Pop?\n",
      "End of flashback.\n",
      "Barney: So now I'm gonna go to L.A., be on the show, win the Showcase Showdown, make him proud of me, and then tell him who I am.\n",
      "Ted: You're gonna tell Bob Barker that you're his son on national television?\n",
      "Barney: Why is this so hard for you people to believe?\n",
      "Robin: Drop the popper! Lily has to gain five pounds in a week and a half, and it is my job to help her get there.\n",
      "Lily: This is the best wedding diet ever.\n",
      "At Robin's...\n",
      "Lily: I lost a pound.\n",
      "Robin: That is impossible. You ate McDonald's every meal for three days.\n",
      "Lily: I knew that Super Size Me guy was full of it.\n",
      "Robin: Well, it must be the wedding stress. We just got to up the intake. Lily Aldrin, drop and give me 20 bites of fudge! Okay? Don't nibble at it. Attack it! Come on, Lily. You can do better than that!\n",
      "Lily: I can't.\n",
      "Robin: Well, eat faster, before your body figures out it's full.\n",
      "Lily: I'm trying.\n",
      "Robin: Oh, are you gonna cry? You gonna cry? Skinny little baby's gonna cry? Well, eat, damn it, eat!\n",
      "Lily: Okay!\n",
      "At the apartment...\n",
      "Ted: Hey, so I think I figured out how to do your toast in a completely appropriate way.\n",
      "Marshall: Finally.\n",
      "Ted: Yeah. Good evening. I'm Ted Mosby, Marshall's best man.\n",
      "Marshall: Still strong, right?\n",
      "Ted: Great, yeah. I'd like to share with you all a story about the momentous evening last fall\n",
      "Flashback. At the bar... Marshall and Lily kissing.\n",
      "Ted: when Marshall and Lily got back together. Afterward, we stayed up till 10:00 at night, doing shots of chocolate milk.\n",
      "Ted (last year): Man, I'm well nourished right now!\n",
      "Barney: Calcium promotes healthy teeth and bones.\n",
      "Robin: Thanks, Marshall, for teaching us you don't need alcohol to have fun.\n",
      "Marshall: Oh, don't thank me. Thank my parents for teaching me good values.\n",
      "Ted: Now, I wasn't supposed to hear this next part, but Marshall leaned over to Lily and whispered.\n",
      "Marshall: You know what I'd like to do to you right now? I'd like to hold your hand. I'd like to hold your hand so hard that you're not able to shake hands for a week.\n",
      "Lily: Are you just going to talk about holding my hand or are you going to hold it?\n",
      "At the bathroom in the bar...\n",
      "Ted: Then a little later, Robin caught them... Oh, um......holding hands. End flashback. It was a lovely and responsible night. To Marshall and Lily.\n",
      "Marshall: That's the worst toast I've ever heard, dude. It's totally boring.\n",
      "Ted: Exactly. It's impossible to write a good toast with you censoring me, man. I give up. I'm just going to read that thing about Jesus and the footprints.\n",
      "Lily: I give up, too. I don't care if my dress doesn't fit. I can't eat anymore. I-I feel like my stomach's going to explode.\n",
      "Marshall: I know.\n",
      "2 weeks later...\n",
      "Ted: And so, Lily and I were both about to give up, but as you can all see, Lily does look beautiful in that dress, and here I am giving a toast. You know, all this time, I'd been wracking my brain trying to pick out the perfect moment to capture Lily and Marshall as a couple. But then I realized the perfect moment wasn't some needle lost in the haystack of their ten years together. The perfect Lily and Marshall moment happened two nights ago.\n",
      "Flashback. At the apartment, Ted comes into the livingroom and Marshall comes homes.\n",
      "Ted: Marshall, what are you doing?\n",
      "Marshall: Going to the bathroom.\n",
      "Ted: In the hall?\n",
      "Marshall: Sleepwalking?\n",
      "Ted: You're wide awake.\n",
      "Marshall: Robbing us?\n",
      "Ted: Dude.\n",
      "Ted (giving the toast): Turns out, all week long he'd been sneaking out to a hotel on 72nd, to meet Lily.\n",
      "Marshall and Lily are liying down on the bed of the hotel room.\n",
      "Lily: God, I missed you.\n",
      "Marshall: I can't sleep without you. Hey, baby? Would you be the big spoon for a while?\n",
      "Lily: Sure, baby.\n",
      "Marshall: How's the weight gaining going?\n",
      "Lily: Ugh, terribly. I'm too stressed out without you around.\n",
      "Marshall: Well, I'm here now.\n",
      "Ted(giving the toast): And so Lily and Marshall failed in their experiment with apartness, but they succeeded in getting Lily into her dress. You know, there really are a million things I could tell you about Lily and Marshall, but really, the only thing you need to know is that ten years into their relationship, they still couldn't spend a single night apart. May they never have to again. To Lily and Marshall.\n",
      "All: To Lily and Marshall.\n",
      "Ted (2030): Now, kids, the story of Lily and Marshall's wedding is a good one. No matter how perfectly you plan your... You know, wait a second, guys. I'll get to that. First, I've got to tell you what happened with Barney.\n",
      "They're all at the apartment watching The Price Is Right...\n",
      "Bob: Rich, what is the name of our next participant?\n",
      "Rich: Bob, it's Barney Stinson! Come on down! You're the next contestant on The Price Is Right.\n",
      "Barney: Nooo. Oh, my God!\n",
      "Bob: Working his way out. High-five here, high-five there. A big old hug here.\n",
      "At the apartment, all: Oh, my God!\n",
      "At the apartment, Barney: Yeah, I know, the camera loves me.\n",
      "Bob: Welcome to contestant's row, Barney. Nice suit.\n",
      "Barney: Thanks, Da... Bob.\n",
      "Bob: Here is the next item up for bid!\n",
      "Rich: Bob, the stylish his-and-her watches feature an 18k gold bezel and crown and stainless steel bands.\n",
      "Bob: And Barney, what do you bid on that?\n",
      "Barney: Um... Wrong. Wrong. Wrong. Wrong. Retail price is $1,349.99, so, since you round off, I'll say $1,350, Bob.\n",
      "Bob: $1,350 for Barney.\n",
      "At the apartment, Lily: So, was it $1,350?\n",
      "At the apartment, Barney: I don't know. Was it?\n",
      "At the apartment, Lily Oh, my God!\n",
      "At the apartment, Barney: Happy wedding.\n",
      "Bob: Barney, you won that camcorder in just one second! That is impressive. I mean impressive.\n",
      "Barney: Thank you, Bob.\n",
      "Bob: Now, to win the computer, you're going to have to bid again, and again I will say higher or lower. And let's show the audience the price of the computer, and audience, please, do not try to help us. And the clock will start with your first bid.\n",
      "Barney: $1 billion.\n",
      "Bob: Lower.\n",
      "Barney: So, I brought some photos that I thought you might like to see. This is me on my first birthday.\n",
      "Bob: Yes, Barney. This is...\n",
      "At the apartment, Ted: What are you doing?\n",
      "At the apartment, Barney: Uh, spending some quality time with my dad.\n",
      "Bob: That's very nice, but look, the clock is moving. You have only about 16 seconds. Keep bidding.\n",
      "Barney: No, no, I want you to see this. This is great.\n",
      "Bob: Keep bidding.\n",
      "Barney. This is me at my graduation. I know, the hair.\n",
      "Bob: That, no, that's nice. That's nice. You have only five, four, three, two, one...\n",
      "Barney: $999.\n",
      "Bob: Nine... Barney, you got it exactly right!\n",
      "At the apartment, Barney: Happy wedding again!\n",
      "At the apartement, Lily: Oh, my...\n",
      "Barney: I have to be honest, Bob. The big wheel is the only weak part of my game.\n",
      "Bob: I'm sure you'll do just fine, son.\n",
      "Barney: Did you just... I'm ready, Bob.\n",
      "Bob: Do it! Do it! Here we go! He's looking for the dollar. It's going around, and around...\n",
      "At the apartment, Ted: Oh, no, you spun it too hard.\n",
      "At the apartment, Robin: No, he didn't spin it hard enough.\n",
      "Bob: Here it comes, Barney. You got it! You won... But Barney... Barney, you're not through. You've won $1,000. You've won a place in the showcase. You are doing splendidly so far.\n",
      "Barney: Thank you, would you, would you say you're proud of me?\n",
      "Bob: Sure.\n",
      "At the apartment, Ted: That was kind of a weird moment.\n",
      "Bob: Very well, Barney, you have seen the first showcase. Do you want to bid on it or do you want to pass it to Millie?\n",
      "Barney: Please, no car and an above-ground spa? Pass.\n",
      "Bob: Millie, he has passed this showcase to you. What do you bid on it?\n",
      "Millie: $17,640.\n",
      "Bob: $17,640.\n",
      "Barney: Overbid!\n",
      "Bob: Now, let's see Showcase #2. Barney, your showcase begins with a mystery.\n",
      "Barney: Oh, I love this.\n",
      "At the apartment, Robin: I can't believe how excited I am right now\n",
      "Bob: Barney, you have seen your showcase. What do you bid on it?\n",
      "Barney: Please, please. Please. Let me. 1-8-4-2-1.\n",
      "At the apartment, Marshall: I don't even know what we're going to do with a dune buggy, but I want it!\n",
      "Bob: And the actual retail price of your showcase is...\n",
      "Barney: $14,628.\n",
      "Bob: $14,628. Millie, you are over. Too bad. Barney, you bid $18,421 on your showcase. And the actual retail price of Barney's showcase is... $18,421 exactly right! You win both showcases, Barney. Bob Barker, reminding you, help control the pet...\n",
      "Barney: Before, before we wrap up the show, there's just something I want to say to you.... Congratulations on 35 wonderful years hosting The Price Is Right.\n",
      "Bob: Well, thank you, Barney. Thank you...\n",
      "Barney: Have your pets spayed or neutered.\n",
      "Ted: Why didn't you tell him?\n",
      "Barney: Well, it's just... If you lived your whole life thinking one thing, it would be pretty devastating to find out that wasn't true. I just don't think Bob could have handled it.\n",
      "Ted: Bob. Yeah. Probably a good choice.\n",
      "Barney: Anyway, on the bright side. Happy wedding again!\n",
      "Ted (2030): And that's the story of how Uncle Barney gave Lily and Marshall a dune buggy for their wedding.\n",
      "Marshall's recording the good night tape for Lily.\n",
      "Marshall: Um, I thought since we're going to be apart for two whole weeks, I would sing you your night-night song. Night-night, Lily Night-night, Lily It's time to go to bed, oh, my silly, little Lily Time to rest your little head Sha-la-la-la-la Sha-la-la-la-la Come on, Ted.\n",
      "Ted: No, it's weird.\n",
      "Marshall: You promised.\n",
      "Ted (2030): In May of 2007, Aunt Lily and Uncle Marshall got married at the historic Van Smoot House in upstate New York.\n",
      "Lily and Robin enter in a house...\n",
      "Robin: Wow, it's beautiful, Lily.\n",
      "Lily: Yeah. It's just how I always pictured it.\n",
      "Ted (2030)Well, that was a load of crap. You see, kids, when you get married, you learn a hard lesson. The wedding you set out to have is almost never the wedding you end up with.\n",
      "At the bar, 8 months before the wedding...\n",
      "Lily: So, we've decided on a small, outdoor wedding, just family and close friends. No more than 25 people in a beautiful garden somewhere, maybe an acoustic guitar playing while we walk down the aisle.\n",
      "Barney: And maybe you already know someone who went down to the courthouse and registered as an officiant so that he or she-- he-- could perform the ceremony.\n",
      "Robin: But you hate marriage. Why do you want to perform the ceremony?\n",
      "Barney: Because it subtly implants in the mind of every woman there that when I ask a question, you say, \"I do.\" Yeah.\n",
      "Ted (2030): The closer you get to the big day, the more concessions you make.\n",
      "At the apartment, 6 months before the wedding...\n",
      "Lily: Great. Now my mom's making me invite the Lessners. This puts our numbers in the triple digits.\n",
      "Robin: Wow. I guess sometimes, Lessner is more... ner. You know how like sometimes less is more.\n",
      "Ted: Yeah. This is one of those times, sweetie?\n",
      "Marshall: You know what? That's okay. It'll be a slightly big outdoor wedding.\n",
      "At the bar, 5 months before the wedding...\n",
      "Lily: So it's not going to be an outdoor wedding anymore. Marshall's dad is convinced if we have an outdoor wedding in New York, he's going to get mugged, so it's going to be inside now. It'll be great. We're still going to have our acoustic guitar player.\n",
      "At the apartment, 3 months before the wedding...\n",
      "Lily: So now, instead of an acoustic guitar, we're having a harp player. Yeah. My dad owes a guy, and... that guy's daughter plays the harp.\n",
      "Barney: Is she hot? I'd love to be able to cross \"harp player\" off my list.\n",
      "Marshall: How long is this list?\n",
      "Barney: Dude, I'm not gonna count how many pages the list is. I'm not crass.\n",
      "Lily: Well, it doesn't matter anyway. She's pregnant.\n",
      "Barney: Sweet! I can cross off two things.\n",
      "CREDITS\n",
      "Ted (2030): And the day arrives for Lily and Marshall's very big indoor wedding... with a harp.\n",
      "1 hour and 42 minutes before the wedding...\n",
      "Andrea: Hi, Lily.\n",
      "Lily: Wow. Andrea. You really are pregnant.\n",
      "Andrea: Yeah.\n",
      "Robin: How do you play the harp with your belly so...?\n",
      "Andrea: Oh, I don't really-- I can only reach about half the strings.\n",
      "Robin: You only play half the harp?\n",
      "Andrea: Yeah.\n",
      "Robin: Oh, no. Uh, okay. Lily, I will take care of this. Um, I'll just pluck the other half. Is it hard to learn?\n",
      "Andrea: I've been studying the harp for 12 years.\n",
      "Robin: Yeah, but I'm a fast learner. You ever hear of \"Guitar Hero\"? Learned that in a day. Is there a \"Harp Hero\"?\n",
      "Lily: Robin, it's fine. So, so, when are you due?\n",
      "Andrea: Tuesday.\n",
      "Lily: Wow, that's soon.\n",
      "Andrea: Last Tuesday.\n",
      "1 hour and 38 minutes before the wedding...\n",
      "Robin: Holy crap, we have to fire her. She's gonna drop a shorty in the middle of your ceremony.\n",
      "Lily: Robin, I'm not going to freak myself out. I hate those women who say, \"Oh, my wedding has to be perfect.\" Things go wrong. Sometimes the deejay screws up your playlist. Sometimes you slip on placenta during the recessional.\n",
      "Barney arrives at the bar of the wedding...\n",
      "Barney: Can I grab a scotch and soda real quick?\n",
      "Barman: No. I'm not allowed to serve anything until the reception.\n",
      "Barney: Wow. You just cost yourself a big tip, buddy.\n",
      "Barman: I'm not allowed to accept tips, buddy.\n",
      "Barney: You allowed to accept criticism? You, sir, are an ass... buddy.\n",
      "In Lily's room...\n",
      "Barney: Hey, you want to know what line doesn't work on a harp player? \"Hey, baby, want to pluck?\"\n",
      "Robin: Really? That didn't work.\n",
      "Barney: Not even a little. Hey! Who's Bill?\n",
      "Lily: Bill?\n",
      "Barney: Yeah. This guy came up to me at the bar.\n",
      "Flashback.\n",
      "Bill: Can I ask you something? Where in the ceremony is the place where they ask if anyone objects?\n",
      "Barney: Uh... Don't think they do that anymore.\n",
      "Bill: Oh, so when do you think someone should do it? Just wait for a lull or what?\n",
      "End of flasback.\n",
      "Lily: Oh, no. Did he look like a guy who tried to be an umpire but failed?\n",
      "Barney: He kind of did.\n",
      "Lily: That's Scooter.\n",
      "Robin: Your high school boyfriend, Scooter?\n",
      "Lily: His real name is Bill. My mom must have invited him.\n",
      "Robin: Why? Why would she do that?\n",
      "Lily: Our families are really close. But my ex-boyfriend? Come on, Mom. I didn't invite that professional squash player Dad busted you with. Oh, I need a glass of wine.\n",
      "Barney: I'll get it.\n",
      "Lily: Oh, thanks. Hey, how's Marshall doing?\n",
      "Barney: He's great. He's about to get his hair cut.\n",
      "Lily: Oh. I'm worried my cousin's going to cut it too short.\n",
      "Barney: Me, too. I was up all night.\n",
      "Barney leaves the room when Scooter comes in...\n",
      "Scooter: Hello, Lily.\n",
      "Barney: Hey, Bill.\n",
      "Scooter: Hey, Barney.\n",
      "Lily: Scooter, what are you doing here?\n",
      "Scooter: It's not \"Scooter\" anymore. It's Bill. A lot of things have changed about me, Lily, but one hasn't. I still love you. And I came here to win you back.\n",
      "Lily: You're really cute. Oh, no. Really?\n",
      "Scooter. Lily, I-I know it's crazy, but I love you, and if you can look me in the eye and tell me that you want to marry Marshall, I will leave right now and be out of your life forever.\n",
      "Lily: I want... I want... Scooter!\n",
      "Barney's back a the bar...\n",
      "Barney: I need a glass of wine.\n",
      "Barman: And I need you to get out of my face.\n",
      "Barney: It's for the bride, so...\n",
      "BarmanWhite or red?\n",
      "Barney: White. And, uh... she'd also like a scotch and soda.\n",
      "Barman: You got it.\n",
      "Barney: She'd also like a bowl of smoked almonds.\n",
      "Barman: I don't have any, but I guess I could run out to the corner and get some.\n",
      "Barney: Well, it's only the biggest day of her life, so...The barman leaves... Let the games begin.\n",
      "47 minutes before the wedding...\n",
      "Barney: Here. Can't stay. Got to try something.\n",
      "Scooter: Maybe my words won't change your mind, but maybe the words of a poet will. I read from \"November Rain.\" By W. Axl Rose.\n",
      "Robin: That is a good song.\n",
      "Brad: Barney said you needed me to bounce some guy named Scooter?\n",
      "Scooter runs out...\n",
      "Brad: What's up with Bill?\n",
      "Robin: That's Scooter.\n",
      "Brad: I'm on it.\n",
      "People start to sit in the wedding place...\n",
      "Barney: Hey.\n",
      "Woman: Hey.\n",
      "Barney: Can I have your phone number?\n",
      "Woman: No.\n",
      "Barney: It's for the bride.\n",
      "Woman: Oh. Hold on. Let me go get a pen.\n",
      "Barney: The bride wants you to walk slower.\n",
      "40 minutes before the wedding, in Lily's wearing her dress...\n",
      "Robin: Oh, wow.\n",
      "Lily: Oh. Robin... My makeup looks perfect right now, and I'm about to cry. Do something.\n",
      "Robin: I have hairy nipples.\n",
      "Lily: Really?\n",
      "Robin: No, but it worked, didn't it?\n",
      "Brad: Hey. Funny story. I tackled this guy I thought was Scooter. Turns out it was your photographer. Don't worry. I got this sweet camera phone, so we're covered.\n",
      "Robin: There's a photographer? Oh, my God. Okay, I just have to call...\n",
      "Lily: Robin, stop. Stop. It's okay. I am not gonna let anything get to me today.\n",
      "33 minutes before the wedding...\n",
      "Woman: I just got a call from the florist. The flowers won't be here till halfway through the ceremony.\n",
      "Lily: I'm okay.\n",
      "28 minutes before the wedding...\n",
      "Man: I hate to bother you, but... I think I found your veil in the parking lot.\n",
      "Lily: I'm fine.\n",
      "24 minutes before the wedding...\n",
      "Andrea: Just FYI: my water broke. But I can probably......make it through.\n",
      "Lily: Totally cool.\n",
      "Robin: Oh, no. Lily, I think I forgot your bridal panties. I-I thought I had them. I'm so sorry.\n",
      "Lily: Oh, it's okay, I'll just wear the ones I have on.\n",
      "Robin: Are you sure?\n",
      "Lily: I'm marrying Marshall today. So it doesn't even matter that I'm gonna walk down the aisle without a veil in a room that has no flowers to the music of half a harp played by a woman who's crowning, as my high school boyfriend reads Guns N' Roses lyrics. But that's okay, because there's no photographer there to take any pictures of it anyway.\n",
      "Robin: Lily, are you okay?\n",
      "Lily: What do you think?! Of course I'm not okay! Everything that could possibly go wrong at my wedding has! It's ruined!\n",
      "Robin: What happened to \"I don't want a perfect wedding\"?\n",
      "Lily: Oh, grow up, Robin! Of course I want a perfect wedding! Oh, God. I wanted... I wanted not to care about the wedding, but... I do. I... I'm supposed to feel like a princess today.\n",
      "Robin: And you will. It's gonna be okay, sweetie. Why don't we go outside? I have something that'll make you feel better.\n",
      "Lily: What could you have that could possibly make me feel better? God, I hope Marshall's having a better day than I'm having.\n",
      "Marshall enters in a room with something to hide his hair...\n",
      "Marshall: Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God!\n",
      "Ted: What?\n",
      "Marshall shows his hair and he has blond drills.\n",
      "Barney: Well, it's not too short.\n",
      "Marshall: My hair! Look at my hair! She ruined my hair! I look like one of the Backstreet Boys!\n",
      "Barney: You totally do. And not even the good Backstreet Boys, the older, lame dance move, comeback tour Backstreet Boys.\n",
      "Ted: The good Backstreet Boys?\n",
      "Marshall: Guys! Guys! What am I gonna do?!\n",
      "Ted: What-what the hell happened to you?\n",
      "Marshall: Lily's cousin is in beauty school, and Lily didn't want her to do her hair, so she said she could do mine.\n",
      "Flashback. Marshall's with Lily's cousin...\n",
      "Marshall: So, um, just not-not too short, okay?\n",
      "Cousin: Oh, no, we don't even have to cut it at all. Could just give it some style.\n",
      "Marshall: Oh, okay, yeah, that's great. 'Cause, um, when it gets too short, it starts to look weird. And I don't want to look weird when I'm up there, you know.\n",
      "Cousin: Ooh, I could give you some cool guy tips.\n",
      "Marshall: I don't think I need advice on how to be cool, but yeah, great, lay that on me.\n",
      "End of flashback.\n",
      "Marshall: I can't get married like this! There's no way!\n",
      "Barney: Ah, let me see what I can do.\n",
      "Ted: What? What can you do?\n",
      "Barney: I have a superpower.\n",
      "Marshall: Lily is gonna kill me! Look at me! She's not gonna want to marry me like this.\n",
      "Ted: That's crazy. Of course she will.\n",
      "Marshall: Would you marry me?\n",
      "Ted: No. But not because of the hair. It's because I have a rule: never marry anyone you've had a farting contest with.\n",
      "Marshall: Oh, great. So now you're saying Lily and I shouldn't even get married?\n",
      "In the wedding room...\n",
      "Barney: Could I have everyone's attention, please? It's for the bride. One, the bride would... like all of this tension out of my shoulders. And she would like, let's say, you in the inappropriatel short dress to rub them. Two... What was two?\n",
      "In Marshall's room...\n",
      "Ted: Okay, we have a bit of a situation. Let's not panic. Let's just find a solution.\n",
      "Marshall takes a razor and shaves the middle of his hair... Dude, you shaved your freakin' head.\n",
      "Marshall: Yeah, yeah, but it's good. I ought to shave it all off. What a great solution. Just be bald 'cause it's cool, right? Bruce Willis, Michael Jordan, Britney Spears... Oh, God, what did I do?! How could you let me shave my head?!\n",
      "Ted: What?!\n",
      "Marshall: You're the worst best man ever! I hate you! I'm not going out there! I'm leaving and I'm never coming back.I'm gonna go find that money under the rock by the tree and go live with the guys on the beach in Zihautanejo.\n",
      "Ted: Dude, those guys are criminals.\n",
      "Marshall: Only Red Andy was falsely accused. Ted, you're my best man! You got to do something!\n",
      "Ted: Okay, all right, come here. Just breathe, breathe, all right? Don't worry. Don't worry. I'll just... I'll take these.\n",
      "Marshall: No!\n",
      "Ted's in the wedding room...\n",
      "Ted: Uh, hi. Uncle Ben, right?\n",
      "Ben: Yes.\n",
      "Ted: Yes, we're, we're having a little bit of a problem back there. Um, and I was wondering if you could help us out.\n",
      "Ben: Yeah.\n",
      "Ted: Marshall accidentally shaved part of his head.\n",
      "Ben: Oh, no!\n",
      "Ted: Yeah. Yeah, so here's what I was thinking. What if I found something to cover up the bald area?\n",
      "Ben: Yeah, that would probably work, but with what? That's a tough one.\n",
      "Ted: Maybe a wig of some sort or a, um... toupee. Something that matches\n",
      "his hair color, which is, which is kind of the same color as the top of your hair.\n",
      "Ben: Mm, yeah. Does anyone here wear a toupee? (Ben's wearing a toupee) Shouldn't be hard to find out. Most of them are pretty bad.\n",
      "Ted: That is true. That is true. We just need to find someone who wears a toupee that is the same color as Marshall's and your hair.\n",
      "Ben: Boy, that's a pretty tall order.\n",
      "Ted: Really? You can't think of any place in the general area where there might be a toupee of the kind I'm describing to you?\n",
      "Ben: No, not off the top of my... No. Can't.\n",
      "Ted: Let me come at this from a different angle. I got $50 in my pocket which is probably a lot more... Barney comes and takes the toupee.\n",
      "Barney: The bride needs this.\n",
      "13 minutes before the wedding, Marshall's wearing the toupee.\n",
      "Marshall: Actually, I think it kinda works.\n",
      "Ted: It totally does.\n",
      "Marshall: Barney?\n",
      "Barney: To be honest, I'm, uh, I'm jealous I don't get to wear it.\n",
      "Marshall: Okay, problem solved. Crisis averted. Let's get me married. It looks terrible, doesn't it?\n",
      "Ted: It kinda looks like fur, which gives you the appearance of a cleaned-up Bigfoot.\n",
      "Marshall: Oh, you know...\n",
      "Ted: In a bad way.\n",
      "Brad: Hey. Cool hair, bro.\n",
      "Ted: What happened to your shirt?\n",
      "Brad: I got sauce on it when I tackled the caterer.\n",
      "Ted: You gonna put another shirt on?\n",
      "Brad: No, I'm good. Hey, you guys seen Scooter?\n",
      "Marshall: What? What? Scooter's here? That guy's at my wedding?\n",
      "Brad: Not for long, bro. Not for long.\n",
      "Marshall: Okay, you know what? I need some air. I think we should go for a walk, okay?\n",
      "In the park...\n",
      "Barney: It would cover up the problem. It's festive and it celebrates the heritage of this great nation.\n",
      "Ted: Okay, unless you actually have one in your car, stop suggesting authentic Native American headdress.\n",
      "Marshall: Oh, no.\n",
      "Lily: Oh, my God! Marshall...\n",
      "Marshall: Lily, you're not supposed to see me.\n",
      "Robin: Holy crap, I don't think anyone's supposed to see you.\n",
      "Lily: What happened? Did Amy do this to you?\n",
      "Marshall: Just the frosted tips. I did the rest. I'm sorry, baby. I've ruined the whole wedding, haven't I?\n",
      "Lily: Oh, no, you didn't ruin the wedding, sweetie. It was already ruined. There's no flowers, no photographer. Oh, and Scooter's here, by the way.\n",
      "Marshall: Yeah, I know. I heard.\n",
      "Lily: My veil got thrashed, the harp player is in labor, and I'm not wearing my wedding underwear.\n",
      "Marshall: What? No \"Property of Marshall\" across the back? How are people going to know whose butt that is?\n",
      "Lily: What happened? Remember the wedding we wanted, the intimate outdoor ceremony?\n",
      "Marshall: I wish we could have that wedding.\n",
      "Ted: So do it.\n",
      "Marshall: What?\n",
      "Ted: Get married now. Right here. Look, it's outside like you always wanted. Intimate, close friends. There's no guitar, but it's pretty close. Barney can officiate.\n",
      "Barney: Yes. Yes, I can. Uh, excuse me, guys. You all dropped something: your jaws-- because Barney Stinson is about to aid and abet a marriage.\n",
      "Marshall: Could we even do that? I mean, what about all those people in there?\n",
      "Robin: Do that one, too. And then when everything goes wrong, you won't care because you already had the real wedding out here.\n",
      "Marshall: What do you think, baby?\n",
      "Lily: I love it.\n",
      "Marshall: Me, too. Let's do it. Let's get married before we get married.\n",
      "Lily: Great. Wait, hold on. Excuse me, sir. Could we borrow your hat?\n",
      "Man: Okay.\n",
      "Lily: Thank you.\n",
      "Lily takes the hat and gives it to Marshall.\n",
      "Marshall: Hat. We thought of authentic Native American headdress before we thought of hat.\n",
      "Barney: Thank you all for coming. For those of you who don't know me... I'm not the biggest believer in marriage. But... you two are so great together, you know? It's like you were, uh, made for each other.\n",
      "Robin: He's gonna cry.\n",
      "Barney: No, I'm not. I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not. Lily and Marshall... when everyone sees you, they... see true love. It's the best love... Can we just, um, move on to the rings or something?\n",
      "Marshall: Oh, no. I don't have my vows.\n",
      "Lily: I don't have mine either.\n",
      "Ted: You don't need your vows. Just say why you love each other.\n",
      "Marshall: Okay, I'll go first. Lily, there are a million reasons why I love you. You make me laugh and you take care of me when I'm sick. You're sweet, caring and you even created an egg dish and named it after me. She puts a little Italian dressing in scrambled eggs before she cooks them. It's called \"Eggs Marshall,\" and it's awesome. But the main reason that I love you is that you're my best friend, Lily. You're, uh... you're the best friend I ever had. I'm sorry, buddy.\n",
      "Ted: No problem.\n",
      "Barney: It's totally okay.\n",
      "Lily: My turn. Oh, thank you. Marshall, I love you because you're funny and you make me feel loved and you make me feel safe and for our anniversary you gave me a sweatshirt that says, \"Lily and Marshall. Rockin' It Since '96.\" I kinda wish I was wearing it right now 'cause it smells like you. But the main reason I love you, Marshall Ericksen, is you make me happy. You make me happy all the time.\n",
      "Robin: Hey, I found your panties!\n",
      "Lily: I'm good.\n",
      "Barney: Marshall, do you take Lily to be your wife to have and to hold from this day forward?\n",
      "Lily: Slow down.\n",
      "Barney: I can't From this day forward so as long as you both shall live?\n",
      "Marshall: I do.\n",
      "Barney: Lily, do you promise to take Marshall to be your husband to have and to hold... live?\n",
      "Lily: I do.\n",
      "Barney: Okay, then, by the power invested in me by the very bitter old Pakistani man who works down at the courthouse on Lafayette Street, I now pronounce you man and wife. You may kiss the bride.\n",
      "They kiss\n",
      "Marshall: Did you smoke?\n",
      "Lily: No.\n",
      "Robin: Wow. First lie of marriage. That was fast.\n",
      "Ted (2030): After that, we all went back inside for the second wedding. And yes, a lot of things did go wrong, but it didn't matter because when I look back on that day, what I remember is the first wedding; the intimate outdoor ceremony with just close friends and an acoustic guitar.\n",
      "In a room...\n",
      "Marshall: How do you feel?\n",
      "Lily: Tired. I got married twice today.\n",
      "Marshall: So where do you want to do it for the first time as a married couple, nice hotel room or a reception hall bathroom?\n",
      "Lily: What do you think? Bathroom, of course.\n",
      "In the bathroom...\n",
      "Ted: Please don't.\n",
      "Man: Ladies and gentlemen, for the first time ever Mr. and Marshall Eriksen and Lily Aldrin.\n",
      "Lily: Does it make you kind of sad that we don't share the same last name?\n",
      "Marshall: You know, in a totally evolved 21st-century kind of way yeah, a little.\n",
      "Lily: You know what we should do? We should come up with a whole new last name.\n",
      "Marshall: Oh, that's easy-- Lily and Marshall Skywalker.\n",
      "Lily: Lily and Marshall Hasselhoff.\n",
      "Marshall: I got it. You ready? You ready?\n",
      "Lily: Yeah.\n",
      "Marshall: Lily and Marshall Awesome. Have you met the Awesomes? Marshall, Lily, their son, Totally and their daughter, Freakin'?\n",
      "Lily: I love you, Mr. Awesome.\n",
      "Marshall: I love you, Mrs. Awesome.\n",
      "They kiss... Robin and Ted dancing...\n",
      "Ted: So...\n",
      "Robin: So...\n",
      "Ted: Wedding's over.\n",
      "Robin: Yes, it is.\n",
      "Ted: I guess starting tomorrow, we can tell people.\n",
      "Barney: Tell people what?\n",
      "Robin: Hi, Barney.\n",
      "Barney: Tell people what?\n",
      "Ted: The food looks delicious, doesn't it?\n",
      "Barney: Tell people what?\n",
      "Robin: Nothing.\n",
      "Barney: Oh, okay. Tell people what?\n",
      "Ted: Can we talk about this later?\n",
      "Barney: Absolutely. Tell people what?\n",
      "Robin: Hi. Have you met Barney?\n",
      "Barney: Hey. Barney Stinson. Lovely dress. I know, I'm sick of these things, too. It's like the same wedding over and over again. You're totally right. You want to dance? Great, see you out there. Tell people what?\n",
      "Ted: Look, this is just not something we want to talk about right now, okay, Barney?\n",
      "Barney: Okay. (Barney leaves)\n",
      "Ted: Whoo, that was a close one.\n",
      "Robin: Think he'll actually let it go?\n",
      "Barney(with a microphone) Tell people what? Tell people what? Tell people what? Tell people what? Tell people... (A man tells him something) There's a black Nissan Stanza in the parking lot with it's lights on. Tell people what? Tell people what?\n",
      "CREDITS\n",
      "Ted and Robin are at the bar of the wedding...\n",
      "Robin: Can I get a water please?\n",
      "Barney: Tell people what?\n",
      "Robin: Oh, God! Okay. Look, we have some... news.\n",
      "Ted: But we don't want to draw attention away from Lily and Marshall's big day.\n",
      "Robin: So just forget about it until they leave for the honeymoon.\n",
      "Barney: Fine.\n",
      "Ted: It's pretty big, though.\n",
      "Barney: Oh, my God, just tell me!\n",
      "Lily: Oh, help us.\n",
      "Robin: What's wrong?\n",
      "Lily: We're starving. We planned this amazing meal with the caterers, and we haven't had a bite of it.\n",
      "Marshall: Every time we get near the food, we get cocktail weiner blocked. We haven't eaten all day.\n",
      "Robin: All right, let's run some interference.\n",
      "Ted: Yeah, we'll get you back to your table. Come on.\n",
      "Lily's grandma: Oh, there you are. My dear, you look so beautiful.\n",
      "Lily: Thanks, Grammie, but we really need to...\n",
      "Lily's grandma: And you... you look like a 1940s movie star.\n",
      "Marshall: And you look like a pepper-crusted rack of lamb with mint jelly.\n",
      "Robin: All right, let's get these two back to their table.\n",
      "Lily's grandma: We will see you on the floor for the conga line later, won't we?\n",
      "Ted(2030): The answer to that one was decided weeks earlier.\n",
      "Flashback. At Ted's apartment.\n",
      "Robin: Conga line.\n",
      "Lily: Oh, yes, definitely.\n",
      "Ted: How about a slide show of you guys through the years set to Green Day's \"Time of Your Life\" and ending with your baby photos side by side.\n",
      "Lily: Oh, that's great. Going on the list.\n",
      "Barney: What list?\n",
      "Lily: Horrible wedding clichées we're not going to touch with a ten-foot limbo pole.\n",
      "Barney: Oh, like First Corinthians? That Bible verse? They do that at every wedding.\n",
      "Robin: How's it go?\n",
      "Marshall: \"Love is patient and kind. \"Love does not envy or boast. \"It is not arrogant or rude. \"Love does not insist on it's own way. \"It is not irritable or resentful. \"Love bears all things, \"believes all things, \"hopes all things... \"endures all things.\"\n",
      "Robin: Lame.\n",
      "Lily: Going on the list.\n",
      "End of flashack. Back to the wedding.\n",
      "Lily: We've done it. A wedding with zero clichées.\n",
      "Ted: Wait, isn't doing it in the reception hall bathroom kind of a clichée?\n",
      "Lily: Well, okay, one clichée.\n",
      "Marshall: Well, technically two.\n",
      "Lily: No! They cleared our plates again!\n",
      "Marshall: Pepper-crusted rack of lamb, where did you go? It's my wedding night. I was supposed to have my way with you.\n",
      "Lily: Well, you still have me.\n",
      "Marshall: Yeah...\n",
      "Barney: Anyway, guys, we're kind of in the middle of something, so if you could go bicker or share a tense, sexless silence or whatever married people do somewhere else, that'd be great.\n",
      "Lily: No, Barney, this is my wedding, and I will sit wherever I damn well...\n",
      "Barney: Are those mini quiches? (Marshall and Lily run) Tell the secret.\n",
      "Ted: Okay, uh... it was our anniversary, so we went to this restaurant Carmichael's, which is where we went on our first date. Remember, the place where I stole the blue French horn for Robin?\n",
      "Barney: Oh, right, that was you. I knew that was somebody I knew.\n",
      "Ted: What? Dude, you were there. That was like a big iconic moment in all of our lives.\n",
      "Barney: Maybe in your life-- I got a lot of stuff going on.\n",
      "Robin: Okay, so we're sitting there and the waiter comes over...\n",
      "Flashback. At the restaurant...\n",
      "Waiter: Champagne?\n",
      "Robin: Um, we didn't order champagne.\n",
      "Waiter: Compliments of the house.\n",
      "Ted: Wow. Thanks. Cheers.\n",
      "Robin (voive over): And there, sitting at the bottom of my champagne glass is...\n",
      "End of flashback. At the wedding...\n",
      "Lily: Mini quiche. You're a mega-douche.\n",
      "Barney: Oh, that's right, they moved that table back toward the kitchen, because that's where they're setting up a surprise chocolate fountain. Oh, no, I gave it away.(Lily and Marshall leave) So what was in the glass?\n",
      "Ted: Right. So the waiter comes up with two glasses of Dom. He says, \"Champagne?\" \"We didn't order any champagne.\" \"Compliments of the house.\" \"Wow.\"\n",
      "Barney: You said that already!\n",
      "Flashback. At the restaurant...\n",
      "Ted (voice over): Right. So Robin looks down, and there at the bottom of her glass...\n",
      "Robin: Is an engagement ring.\n",
      "End of Flashback.\n",
      "Man( with a camera): Anything you want to say to the bride and groom?\n",
      "Barney: Don't get married.\n",
      "Man: Why don't I come back.\n",

      "Kids, the early bloom of a romance is a wonderful thing. You meet someone, you have a connection, and that person becomes sheer perfection in your eyes. You just can't find anything wrong with them. And you can't wait to tell the world about it.\n",
      "She convinced you to go jogging?\n",
      "Wow, you really want to get in this girl's pants.\n",
      "I'm telling you, you guys are gonna love her.\n",

      "How not hotter?\n",
      "So we all went out to dinner, and I couldn't wait to see if my friends were as crazy about Cathy as I was.\n",
      "So, what's everyone getting?\n",
      "Well, I can't decide.\n",

      "I'm a minute away from finding out if I'm gonna be a lawyer or not.\n",
      "You see, kids, during the summer, Marshall had taken the New York Bar exam. His years of school, his countless hours of study, had finally culminated in this grueling, two-day ordeal.\n",
      "And... begin.\n",
      "The pressure of it was enormous. Every year, people taking the bar simply cracked. But Marshall had made it through.\n",

      "Half.\n",

      "Was it...\n",
      "I'll be back in one second.\n",
      "One time, in the tenth grade, as a joke, I told everyone that my English teacher had s*x with me.\n",

      "Or maybe...\n",
      "I'll be back in a second.\n",

      "Yeah.\n",

      "Or...\n",

      "I bet he's going to the urinal.\n",
      "Yeah. I remember when I had a pen1s.\n",
      "It wasn't anything she did while you were in the bathroom.\n",
      "It's just the way she is.\n",
      "I don't get it. If it's so obvious and you guys all see it, how come I don't?\n",
      "'Cause we're not trying to have s*x with her.\n",
      "Brother, you're driving the \"I want to have s*x with her\" truck, and it's got a huge blind spot.\n",
      "That's ridiculous.\n",
      "Is it really?\n",
      "Ted, let me tell you a little story about a young lady I wanted to have s*x with...\n",
      "Lucilia.\n",
      "On a white sand beach in Rio de Janeiro, we made love for ten straight hours.\n",
      "When we were done, she applauded and told me I was far, far better than the best lover she could possibly imagine, and that I had restored her faith in God.\n",
      "What does this have to do with Cathy?\n",
      "Who's Cathy?\n",
      "Just tell me what the hell is wrong with her already.\n",
      "Okay. You want to know?\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "You want to shatter this beautiful illusion you've created for yourself?\n",
      "Fine. Here it is.\n",
      "Cathy talks...\n",
      "a lot.\n",
      "Oh, come on. That's not true.\n",
      "Ted. Really, really think about that dinner we all just had together.\n",
      "And I did.\n",
      "So, what's everyone getting?\n",
      "Well, I can't decide.\n",
      "Which sounds better, chicken or lasagna?\n",
      "I like chicken. I like lasagna. I like them both, but I really like pork. A lot of people don't eat pork, and maybe it's because of that movie Babe or something.\n",
      "But that was funny. He was a talking pig and he was like \"Bah, Ram, Ewe!\"\n",
      "What-what if there was a sorority, \"Bah, Ram, Ewe?\"\n",
      "I'd totally rush it. ...And so I named him Dr. Seuss!\n",
      "Lorax is a funny word.\n",
      "Lasagna! Just get the lasagna!\n",
      "Oh, you guys just got a new place.\n",
      "How many bedrooms is it?\n",
      "I would love to have an extra bedroom, because I would put a Stairmaster in there.\n",
      "But you guys should get a convertible sofa.\n",
      "Or a futon. Futons are great. Or what about one of those Murphy beds?\n",
      "Who invented the Murphy bed? Was it a guy named Murphy?\n",
      "Oh, my God. Do you guys remember that show Murphy Brown?\n",
      "That was a funny show. She had a new assistant every episode. ...and it was like half an hour before I realized he wasn't even on the phone anymore! Isn't that hysterical?\n",
      "Two! It's two bedrooms!\n",
      "Hey, do you guys like cannolis?\n",
      "Because I know this place and it's in the South Bronx and you wouldn't expect it, but they have the best cannolis in town.\n",
      "And just like that, the illusion was shattered.\n",
      "She just never shuts up, does she?\n",
      "She didn't stop to swallow her food.\n",
      "I was scared for her. I didn't want her to choke.\n",
      "At first.\n",
      "So kids, this girls I was dating would not stop talking. Can you imagine how awful that is?\n",
      "Do you own a wok?\n",
      "'Cause that's really how...\n",
      "Don't you just love autumn?\n",
      "Today I'm dressed for... Oh, my God. The sweetest thing.\n",
      "And I know this great place where we can go.\n",
      "They have guys and girls clothes. We could both shop at the same time.\n",
      "And a lot of times boyfriends and girlfriends...\n",
      "Hey! Why are you running so fast?\n",
      "Well, thank you, pal. You and your little friends, you just had to tell me.\n",
      "You just had to give in to my incessant begging.\n",
      "You said that you wanted to know.\n",
      "I didn't want to know!\n",
      "You said you wanted to know!\n",
      "Well, I didn't know I didn't want to know! You knew.\n",
      "And you know me. And you should have known I didn't want to know!\n",
      "You know?\n",
      "I'm sorry we told you. I'm surprised she didn't tell you herself at some point.\n",
      "There's only a finite combination of words in the English language.\n",
      "Well, you could have let me enjoy it a little longer.\n",
      "She's got all these other great qualities. She's smart.\n",
      "She's caring. She loves animals...\n",
      "You know how to teach her a lesson? Buy her a parrot.\n",
      "Oh, come on. I'm sorry that we told you, okay?\n",
      "It's part of being in a relationship.\n",
      "Eventually, you get used to these annoying little things that bug you at first.\n",
      "Yeah, I guess.\n",
      "I mean, you got used to Lily's loud chewing, right?\n",
      "Lily doesn't chew loudly.\n",
      "Dude... Come on. This isn't news.\n",
      "Why do you think I call her \"Chewbacca\"?\n",
      "I assumed because she's loyal, wears shiny belts and I resemble a young Harrison Ford.\n",
      "Think about it.\n",
      "Oh, man, honestly, dude, that's the meanest thing you've ever done to me.\n",
      "I really thought you knew.\n",
      "We had ribs the other night. It sounded like Jurassic Park.\n",
      "Ha-ha-ha. You know what? It doesn't matter.\n",
      "But it did.\n",
      "Say, what's in that cereal besides dry twigs and small animal bones?\n",
      "What's that supposed to mean?\n",
      "Lily, I love you, but honest to God, when you eat, it sounds like a garbage disposal full of drywall screws.\n",
      "What's the matter with you?\n",
      "We've been together ten years, and you're saying this now?\n",
      "Well, I never noticed it before until...\n",
      "Until what?\n",
      "Can you believe Ted? What a lame thing to say, that I'm a loud chewer.\n",
      "Yeah, that's crazy.\n",
      "Maybe enough with the pretzels.\n",
      "Oh, my God, do I really chew that loudly?\n",
      "No, no, no.\n",
      "Okay, now that you pointed it out, maybe it does sound slightly like someone put a screwdriver in a pencil sharpener, but in a cute way.\n",
      "This is all Ted's fault. Oh, like he's so perfect, Mr. Corrector.\n",
      "What do you mean?\n",
      "Oh, come on. You dated the guy for a year and you never noticed that most of what Ted says is correcting you.\n",
      "Hey, can you hand me a Kleenex?\n",
      "Actually, Kleenex is a brand. This is a facial tissue.\n",
      "Oh, my God, is Frankenstein gonna kill that little girl?\n",
      "Uh, Dr. Frankenstein isn't in this scene.\n",
      "That's Frankenstein's monster.\n",
      "That literally blew my mind.\n",
      "Figuratively.\n",
      "Oh, my God, you're right.\n",
      "That is so annoying.\n",
      "Isn't it?\n",
      "Where are those pretzels from, Ace Hardware?\n",
      "Hey, man, you like kettle corn? I'm trying to get rid of anything crunchy.\n",
      "Are the blinds closed?\n",
      "I don't know.\n",
      "Are the blinds closed?!\n",
      "Yes, the blinds are closed.\n",
      "Good, I didn't think I was followed, but you can never be too sure.\n",
      "Now double-lock the door and stay away from the windows.\n",
      "Is there a reason that you're acting like this?\n",
      "We're about to find out if you're a lawyer.\n",
      "Now, in good conscience, I have to inform you that using this software is in violation of the Patriot Act, the Strategic Defense Initiative, and the National Security Act of 1948, which created the CIA.\n",
      "So I hope you passed the bar because if we use this software, the night janitor Gligor who I fooled into putting fingerprints on my computer, is going to need a good lawyer.\n",
      "Are you certain you want to go through with this?\n",
      "I have to know, yes, yes.\n",
      "Very good.\n",
      "First, we go to the New York State Bar Web site.\n",

      "Yes.\n",

      "Right! Isn't that awesome?\n",
      "So you went through all this just to get me to look at your stupid video?\n",
      "Yeah, it was worth it.\n",
      "Barney, Barney, that was the biggest test of my life.\n",
      "I'm incredibly stressed out right now, and I...\n",
      "Okay, that's pretty funny.\n",
      "You got to see this.\n",
      "Yeah, I have to...\n",
      "She'll call back when she realizes I'm gone.\n",
      "Probably in about 45 minutes.\n",
      "Hey.\n",
      "Hi.\n",
      "You guys want a drink?\n",
      "I'll just have a water.\n",
      "Mm, technically, water is a drink.\n",
      "Really, Professor? You drink it?\n",
      "Is that how water works?\n",
      "Because I was just gonna smear it on my skin and hope that I absorbed it.\n",
      "Or you could, you know, pour it over your shirt.\n",
      "What's with you?\n",
      "You're always correcting people.\n",
      "You totally do that!\n",
      "That's absolutely right.\n",
      "Right? I never noticed it before, and now it's literally driving me crazy.\n",
      "Figuratively.\n",
      "Okay, maybe so, but it's no worse than you using the word \"literally\"\n",
      "in every other sentence.\n",
      "Don't they teach vocabulary in Canada?\n",
      "They literally don't. They literally don't.\n",

      "Oh, see? You can't think of anything 'Cause I'm awesome!\n",
      "All three right there.\n",

      "All: General idea.\n",
      "Kids, back to 2007, it seems like everyone belonged to these silly things called gyms. The idea was you'd pay them lots of money to run around and lift heavy things. Biggest rip-off in the world. And yet people fell for it. Including me.\n",

      "Well, I go to Total Rip Fitness, but I don't work out there.\n",
      "What do you do?\n",
      "I invest.\n",
      "There goes one of my investments now.\n",
      "Cheryl, hard work's paying off. Keep up the good work.\n",
      "So your investments... are women?\n",
      "Women who, how shall I put this delicately?\n",
      "They fat.\n",
      "So, I come here, give them lots of attention now.\n",
      "Then when they get hot, who's the first guy they run to?\n",
      "The one who invested in them when they weren't.\n",

      "What up?\n",
      "Wow, that makes me want to join a gym.\n",
      "So I can get super strong and punch you really hard in the face.\n",
      "Yes, we should all do it.\n",
      "Yeah, let's all punch Barney in the face.\n",
      "we might as well take it off together.\n",

      "It's a pleasure. Marshall, can I talk to you for a second?\n",
      "Yeah, sweetie, I think she is...\n",
      "may be just a little too hot to be your trainer.\n",
      "I get it.\n",

      "All right.\n",
      "Start with 100 push-ups.\n",
      "All right, cool. How many do you want me to do?\n",
      "A hundred.\n",
      "Oh, I thought that was a figure of speech, 100 push-ups, like, do a bazillion push-ups. No one can do 100.\n",
      "Do you smell that?\n",
      "No.\n",
      "It smells like there's a little bitch in my gym.\n",
      "Are you being a little bitch in my gym?\n",
      "No.\n",

      "Hey, Barney Stinson from Staten Island Boulevard. What can I get you?\n",
      "I can't believe she didn't remember me.\n",
      "Why? Who is she?\n",
      "That's Rhonda.\n",
      "I lost my virginity to her.\n",
      "Baby, are you still sore?\n",
      "Trish made me do 70 push-ups, but she only gave me credit for ten.\n",
      "Then she had me do 100 sit-ups and then she made me cry, using only her words.\n",
      "It just doesn't add up.\n",
      "How could Rhonda not remember me?\n",
      "Well, maybe it wasn't that good for her. I mean, it was your first time.\n",
      "Ted, it's me.\n",
      "I rocked her world.\n",
      "You don't believe me? Okay, story time.\n",
      "The year was 1998.\n",
      "I'd been going out with Shannon since freshman year of college.\n",
      "We were saving ourselves.\n",
      "So when we broke up there I was, 23 and still a virgin.\n",
      "I knew nothing about girls.\n",
      "So I went to the guy who knew everything about girls my brother James.\n",
      "Wait, your gay brother James?\n",
      "Yeah, this was before he was gay.\n",
      "Barney... Barney, you need to find a girl and have s*x with her ASAP.\n",
      "That is what dudes do after a breakup.\n",
      "I know. I want to, but...\n",
      "I guess I'm just scared.\n",
      "Of course you're scared. It's gross.\n",
      "The thought of doing that with a woman...\n",
      "But it's part of being a guy.\n",
      "Try thinking about baseball.\n",
      "Somehow I imagine those players on the field and it's over a lot faster.\n",
      "But I don't know the first thing about seducing a woman.\n",
      "What do you...? How do you...? Where do you...?\n",
      "Stop. Don't overthink it.\n",
      "You don't want to get the yips.\n",
      "The yips?\n",
      "Yeah, when you overthink simple things so much that you can't do them at all.\n",
      "The yips.\n",
      "Yeah, it happens to athletes all the time.\n",
      "Like the second baseman who suddenly can't throw to first or the figure skater who does a perfect triple toe loop and then loses it on the arabesque.\n",
      "I've actually really been getting into figure skating lately.\n",
      "But, James...\n",
      "what woman's going to have s*x with me?\n",
      "It's not like I'm a Backstreet Boy.\n",
      "The Man Maker.\n",
      "Rhonda \"Man Maker\" French was our mom's friend from down the street.\n",
      "Got any kings?\n",
      "Go fish.\n",
      "So, Patty, know that new paperboy?\n",
      "I let him throw one into my hedges, if you know what I mean.\n",
      "Did you see that new guy who cleans my pool?\n",
      "I let him snake my drain, if you know what I mean.\n",
      "You know that Chinese food delivery boy?\n",
      "I had s*x with him.\n",
      "I don't have a funny way of saying it yet. It just happened 20 minutes ago.\n",
      "Of course.\n",
      "The Man Maker.\n",
      "And it'll be easier too, 'cause she knows me so well.\n",
      "Hi, Barry.\n",
      "Barney.\n",
      "Hi, Ms. French. I know we haven't seen each other for a while, but if there was any chance... Oh, boy.\n",
      "You just rocked my world.\n",
      "That was the best s*x I ever had.\n",
      "That was the night I was born.\n",
      "I rose like a phoenix from her mentholated bosom and strode into the world, Armani clad and fully awesome.\n",
      "God, please let me stop!\n",
      "Yes, great, let's stop. Let's just kick back and wait for the massive coronary you're going to have a couple years from now when you're 40.\n",
      "I'm... I'm 29.\n",
      "50 more!\n",
      "Hi, sweetie.\n",
      "I got a trainer, too. This is Max.\n",
      "We're going to focus on flexibility.\n",
      "Yeah, I'm gonna stretch her out.\n",
      "Great... Wait, what?\n",
      "50 more, now!\n",
      "Okay, well, that's not cool.\n",
      "You know, Rhonda, running into you really got me thinking about the old days.\n",
      "You were quite popular.\n",
      "I sure got around back then.\n",
      "And there was one young man who stood out above the pack.\n",
      "Freddy Chibatoni. That kid had a tongue like a gecko.\n",
      "No, no, I was thinking about someone else.\n",
      "Chaz Alderman. Hips like a woman, but he knew how to use them.\n",
      "What about me?!\n",
      "You?\n",
      "Yes. We slept together.\n",
      "And you said I was the best you ever had.\n",
      "Did I?\n",
      "Oh, right.\n",
      "About that...\n",
      "And tell him that he's the best you ever had.\n",
      "Oh, I don't know.\n",
      "He's just a kid.\n",
      "No he isn't. He's 23 and he is really hurting, Rhonda.\n",
      "Please.\n",
      "Maybe we could make a deal.\n",
      "What?\n",
      "No, girl, I got a girlfriend.\n",
      "Yeah, yeah, yeah, hers is the only vagina for me.\n",
      "Oh... I love it.\n",
      "It... it isn't scary at all.\n",
      "Well, too bad. I guess your brother's going to stay a virgin.\n",
      "Fine.\n",
      "Reggie Jackson, Reggie Jackson, Reggie Jackson...\n",
      "But those compliments you gave me.\n",
      "You just rocked my world.\n",
      "That was the best s*x I ever had.\n",
      "But you said I rocked your world.\n",
      "All subsequent worlds that I rocked were only so rocked because of the confidence I earned from said first world rocking.\n",
      "Sorry, Barry.\n",
      "It's Barney.\n",
      "So I'm doing sit-ups and she says, \"All right, Marshall, just one more set.\"\n",
      "So I summon all my strength and I do that set, and then she says, \"Give me another set.\"\n",
      "So I'm like, \"Is this the last set?\"\n",
      "And she says yes. So I do that set and then she says, \"Give me another set.\" She lied to my face!\n",
      "Everything hurts.\n",
      "Baby, the whole point of working out is to feel better.\n",
      "This trainer is making you miserable. You have to call her and quit.\n",
      "I got to work through it. I got to finish what I started.\n",
      "If you're too scared, I can call her.\n",
      "Her number's on this card.\n",
      "Hi. Is this Trish?\n",
      "This is Marshall's wife. Listen, we have a problem here and it's you.\n",
      "I don't know who the hell you think you are, but from now on, you don't tell Marshall what to do.\n",
      "You are an employee. We tell you what to do.\n",
      "And I'm telling you you're fired, bitch.\n",
      "Okay, bye. You better get down there, baby. She's pretty pissed.\n",
      "Hey, buddy. Still bummed about the whole Rhonda thing?\n",
      "No. Why would I let the approval of one woman define who I am?\n",
      "That's very mature of you, Barney.\n",
      "Let him finish.\n",
      "When I can let the approval of a gaggle of supermodels define who I am. What? What?\n",
      "Three tickets to the after party of the Victoria's Secret fashion show?\n",
      "Uh, kablammie!\n",
      "Lily, um, could I go?\n",
      "Go. You're too sore to do anything anyway.\n",
      "Okay, this, boys, is not a regular season game.\n",
      "This is the World Series.\n",

      "Ooh, that's bad.\n",
      "You know, in Germany, we call this #@%!. Whoa, that is bad.\n",
      "I don't know what's happened to me. I've, I've totally lost my confidence.\n",
      "Barney, maybe you have to open up to somebody.\n",
      "Maybe you have to open up to some...\n",
      "He just found out that the woman he lost his virginity to only did it because his brother bribed her.\n",
      "That's a rough one.\n",
      "I mean, the only thing I can think of to get rid of #@%! is you have to go out there. And you need to find that woman.\n",
      "And you need to earn it with her for real.\n",

      "Let's s*x.\n",
      "What are you talking about? I'm watching Wheel of Fortune.\n",
      "You can keep watching. I'll face you toward the TV.\n",
      "That's a cute idea, kid.\n",
      "Great.\n",
      "No, I'm not having s*x with you. Sit down a minute.\n",
      "I'm not the Man Maker anymore. You know what?\n",
      "About five years ago, I realized there was an emptiness inside of me that no amount of meaningless s*x could fill.\n",
      "I needed something more.\n",
      "And that's when I discovered Indian casinos.\n",
      "Hey, Barney, it's weird not seeing you in a suit. What's going on?\n",
      "Uh, not much.\n",
      "My entire sexual history was built on a rotting foundation of lies.\n",
      "My whole identity is lost in a pit of menthol ashes.\n",

      "Yeah, I'm done there, too. That place is horrible.\n",
      "What about your big muscular trainer who's so into stretching you out?\n",
      "Yeah, well, turns out that guy had no affiliation with the gym whatsoever.\n",
      "Come on, guys, don't give up on the gym.\n",
      "It's been great for us.\n",

      "It's not true. I was there today.\n",
      "Yeah, but didn't you leave early?\n",
      "Oh, great.\n",
      "Now I got to go home and charge this.\n",
      "Wait a minute.\n",
      "You didn't work out Tuesday either.\n",
      "Brought the wrong shorts.\n",
      "Yeah, and you totally disappeared on Monday, too.\n",
      "No, I was at the gym the whole time.\n",

      "Oh, honey...\n",
      "I just, I don't get it.\n",
      "You slept with so many guys. You slept with my brother.\n",
      "We are practically the same person. Was I really so bad?\n",
      "Nobody's good the first time.\n",

      "Oh, no, no. Oh, no.\n",

      "Just for tonight, okay?\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "But it's gonna be an uphill battle.\n",
      "I am just saying we have to think of the right angle.\n",
      "I have a third one, but I'm not gonna say it.\n",
      "Okay, Barney, I think we've stumbled into some kind of ethical, philosophical wormhole.\n",
      "Green suit.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "I ditched Marshall and Lily, and was rewarded with two beautiful girls.\n",
      "Suit's made of green.\n",

      "38 long.\n",
      "It's like the laws of the universe are working in reverse.\n",
      "Can you put it on my tab?\n",
      "Yeah. What's the last name?\n",
      "Garrido.\n",
      "All right, I'm gonna try something, and if this works...\n",
      "Uh, hey.\n",
      "Hey, what can I get you guys?\n",

      "Ted, listen.\n",
      "Are you hearing that? That's the universe.\n",
      "The universe is talking to us.\n",
      "We don't have to build a baseball field, do we?\n",
      "No. The universe is telling us that we have a free pass tonight.\n",
      "The universe is saying that we don't have to live in fear of the...\n",

      "That's it.\n",

      "What was that?\n",
      "What's going on here?\n",
      "Okay, Lily...\n",
      "while you were in the other room, Robin and I, we discovered something about the apartment.\n",
      "It's not a big deal.\n",
      "It's not like a disaster. It's just...\n",
      "It's something that we're going to have to learn to live with.\n",
      "Robin and I saw a ghost.\n",
      "What?\n",
      "Oh, he's kidding, right?\n",
      "No, we really saw a ghost.\n",
      "What did it look like?\n",
      "Uh, a sheet with two holes in it.\n",
      "He was a Confederate general who was wounded at the Battle of Antietam, and he died at the army hospital which once stood on this very spot.\n",
      "And now he wanders these halls, vowing revenge against the Union cannonade hat once felled him.\n",
      "But he seems nice. He's a good-good guy.\n",
      "Marshall, you see ghosts everywhere. You see ghosts at Stars Bucks.\n",
      "That Kenny G holiday CD just flew off the shelf.\n",
      "Last time that happened.\n",
      "But, Robin, you're a skeptic, so if you say you saw a ghost...\n",
      "It passed right through me, and suddenly I felt cold, so very cold.\n",
      "You know, Ashlee, I'm sorry.\n",
      "You're probably just gonna want to get up and walk away, but I just have to test out this theory I've been working on.\n",
      "Tonight, I am not looking for a relationship.\n",
      "I really just want to hook up with you, leave before breakfast, and never see you again.\n",
      "I'm in.\n",
      "Unbelievable.\n",
      "Hot damn, that's a deep navel.\n",
      "No tomorrow, Ted.\n",
      "Yeah, no tomorrow, Barney.\n",
      "No tomorrow, huh?\n",
      "I like that idea.\n",
      "Because if there is a tomorrow, I'm gonna be in a lot of trouble.\n",
      "Oh, yeah? Why is that?\n",
      "I'm married.\n",
      "Tell me you're messing with me, guys.\n",
      "You didn't actually see a ghost.\n",
      "It's not a big deal, baby. He seemed friendly.\n",
      "You said he's a Confederate general. They're the bad guys.\n",
      "And he's probably racist.\n",
      "No, he seemed polite.\n",
      "He had courtly Southern manners.\n",
      "We're gonna raise our kids here.\n",
      "I don't want some Confederate general ghost teaching them his racism.\n",
      "He loves people of all colors and creeds.\n",
      "He was fighting for states' rights, that's all.\n",
      "Robin said he was wearing a sheet.\n",
      "What do you think that means?\n",
      "The apartment is crooked.\n",
      "What?\n",
      "Robin and I didn't see a ghost.\n",
      "The floor is crooked, isn't it?\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "We spent our entire life's savings on this floor.\n",
      "The next 30 mortgage-paying years of our lives will be spent on this floor, and it's crooked.\n",
      "Thanks a lot, Robin.\n",
      "How is \"racist ghost\" better than \"crooked\"?\n",
      "Seriously, somebody tell me how that's better.\n",
      "Oh, I'm sorry.\n",
      "Oh, that's okay.\n",
      "Um, dude, so, I'm having second thoughts about that theory.\n",
      "I'm telling you, if you want to know how old a woman is, check her elbows.\n",
      "Not that theory.\n",
      "You have to be more specific, Ted, 'cause I have so many theories.\n",
      "The whole do bad, good things happen...\n",
      "Ashlee is married.\n",
      "So?\n",
      "What do you mean, so?\n",
      "Open your brain tank, brah, 'cause here comes some premium 91 octane knowledge.\n",
      "There's three rules of cheating:\n",
      "It's not cheating if you're not the one who's married, it's not cheating if her name has two adjacent vowels, and it's not cheating if she's from a different area code.\n",
      "You're fine on all three counts.\n",
      "How do you know she's from a different area code?\n",
      "She's 516.\n",
      "She might dress like she's 718, act like she's 212, but trust me, she's 516.\n",
      "Oh, and her husband...\n",
      "letting her out alone on Saint Patty's Day?\n",
      "If that dude's not 973, I'm 307.\n",
      "Wyoming.\n",
      "We're gonna have to nail down all our furniture.\n",
      "We won't be able to get a pinball machine.\n",
      "I mean, unless we put some books under two of the legs or something.\n",
      "But then what if we want to read those books?\n",
      "This is a nightmare.\n",
      "We can't raise our kids here. They'll grow up slanted.\n",
      "If we have a daughter, we'll have to call her Eileen.\n",
      "I don't think we can live here, Marshall.\n",
      "I don't know what we're gonna do.\n",
      "Marshall?\n",
      "Open the door.\n",
      "If I make it through the door, that's five points.\n",
      "Woo-hoo!\n",
      "Yeah!\n",
      "Five points.\n",
      "Ten bucks says I can do it backwards.\n",
      "So Lily and Marshall decided to make the best of a bad situation. And that's also how the sport of Apartment Roller Luge was invented.\n",
      "Very careful baby! Oh yeah!\n",
      "So she's married? It's not like she has kids.\n",
      "How do you know?\n",
      "Wrists.\n",
      "It's like you don't even listen to me.\n",
      "Oh, hey.\n",
      "Hey.\n",
      "Where'd you go?\n",
      "Well, I just, um...\n",
      "Was it something I said?\n",
      "No, no, no, it's just, well...\n",
      "you're married and-and we've been drinking, and I was worried we might...\n",
      "Oh, this is a very bad idea.\n",
      "We have a problem.\n",
      "Hey, hey. Hey.\n",
      "Hey.\n",
      "Is this your husband?\n",
      "I've never seen this man in my life.\n",
      "Oh, okay. Uh, what's our problem?\n",
      "Rick. Rick Garrido.\n",
      "According to the bartender, I'm the guy that's been buying you champagne all night.\n",
      "Okay, there's-there's a very simple explana...\n",
      "Next thing I know the police show up, they arrest the other guy, and I'm drinking for free the rest of the night.\n",
      "It was awesome.\n",
      "Awesome, huh?\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "You don't see anything wrong with that story?\n",
      "Well, I lost my new phone back at the club somewhere.\n",
      "What the hell is wrong with you, dude?\n",
      "You know me, I lose things.\n",
      "You kissed a married woman, Ted.\n",
      "You committed credit card fraud.\n",
      "You... you kissed a married woman. Do you know how offensive that is to me?\n",
      "You're turning into Barney.\n",
      "We don't need another Barney.\n",
      "Look... it's Saint Patty's Day.\n",
      "It wasn't as bad as it sounds.\n",
      "\"It wasn't as bad as it sounds\"?\n",
      "No.\n",
      "Huh? Okay...\n",
      "I want you to hear exactly how it sounds, Ted.\n",
      "First skipped message: I don't see no ring on this finger.\n",
      "And then last night started coming back to me:\n",
      "The real version.\n",
      "Are the girls in there hotter than our dates ?\n",
      "I don't know if they're hotter, but they're drunker.\n",
      "Rock 'n' roll.\n",
      "How many messages did I...\n",
      "Seventeen...\n",
      "Kids, it's sometimes possible to think you're doing just fine in life...\n",
      "Next message: Can you put it on my tab?\n",
      "Sure, what's the last name?\n",
      "Garrido.\n",
      "...and then someone opens your eyes a little bit, and you realize...\n",

      "...your whole world is off balance...\n",
      "Next message: ...out of whack...\n",
      "Okay, look, brah, there is a very simple explana...\n",
      "...crooked.\n",
      "That was hard to listen to.\n",
      "No one likes how they sound on an answering machine.\n",
      "Thanks for doing that.\n",
      "You yelled at me.\n",
      "You got very firm with me.\n",
      "Very confident.\n",
      "It was cool.\n",
      "Thanks.\n",
      "You're very sexy when you yell, Marshall.\n",
      "Shut up.\n",
      "Veins, crazy muscles in your neck.\n",
      "You look like a Kentucky Derby-winning steed.\n",

      "At one point, I swear, I thought we were gonna kiss.\n",
      "Ted, seriously.\n",
      "I'm married.\n",
      "Oh... a slanted floor.\n",
      "Architecturally speaking, fixing that's going to be...\n",

      "I'm going to go grab some more glue.\n",
      "Will you watch them for a sec?\n",
      "Of course.\n",
      "Leaving Nicholson, Hewitt, and West was a huge mistake, and I can see that now.\n",
      "So... who wants to see the big guy put on these tiny hats?\n",
      "My behavior was disrespectful.\n",
      "It was unprofessional.\n",
      "I'm a pilgrim.\n",
      "I know it looks like I have a tiny hat, but in reality, I have an abnormally large head!\n",
      "I was going through a stressful time.\n",
      "I wasn't getting enough sleep.\n",
      "Fourscore and seven years ago, I had a great, big giant head!\n",
      "I had just bought an apartment, and there were some problems.\n",
      "I- I don't want to bore you with the details.\n",
      "I only regret that I have but one giant head to give for my country.\n",
      "Sir, if you could just see your way into giving me one more chance, I promise... Marshall.\n",
      "I'm willing to give this a second chance.\n",
      "I remember my first years as an attorney.\n",
      "Why, I don't know how many hours I spent.\n",
      "I don't think I ever left...\n",
      "Oh, my God!\n",
      "I have lice.\n",
      "Those little bastards gave me lice.\n",
      "God, it itches.\n",
      "Don't scratch it.\n",
      "You'll look like a fool.\n",
      "You'll never get your job back.\n",
      "Okay, you can scratch, but just make it subtle.\n",
      "Okay, that's not working.\n",
      ", sweet, sharp corner of the desk, how I long to rub my infested scalp against you.\n",
      "I was, um... just, uh...\n",
      "You okay, Eriksen?\n",
      "Oh! Oh, yes, I'm good.\n",
      "I am good.\n",
      "Continue.\n",
      "Mind over matter.\n",
      "There are no lice in my hair... laying eggs, burrowing into my scalp,\n",
      "eating their way all the way down to my brain![/i]\n",
      "I have lice!\n",
      "\"Lice\"?! Lice! Get out!\n",
      "Get out of my office!\n",
      "We've got lice!\n",
      "Everybody out of the building.\n",
      "If it weren't for the lice, I would have gotten my job back, and I would have been working there when,\n",
      "two weeks later, the Securities and Exchange Commission came a-knocking.\n",
      "God sent those lice to my head like he sent the locusts to Egypt:\n",
      "to liberate me from corporate bondage.\n",
      "Miracle.\n",
      "Hey, guys.\n",
      "Oh, I'm just so glad you and Ted are back together. Yeah.\n",
      "Wait, um, what do you mean \"back together\"?\n",
      "Well, you know, since you guys broke up.\n",
      "What? Oh, no.\n",
      "It was just a small fight.\n",
      "That wasn't a breakup.\n",
      "Was that a breakup? Did he think that was a breakup?\n",
      "What?\n",
      "Son of a bitch!\n",
      "That was a breakup. Wasn't it?\n",
      "You broke up with me.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "I didn't know that that was a breakup.\n",
      "Are you kidding?\n",
      "I- I said, \"I feel awful. \"\n",
      "You said, \"We're good. \"\n",
      "Then you got up and left.\n",
      "Yeah, I said, \"We're good, \" as in \"We're good. \"\n",
      "Like when the waiter comes around and asks if you want any more muffins, and you say, \"We're good. \"\n",
      "Exactly, and I took that \"We're good\" to mean you didn't want any more metaphorical relationship muffins.\n",
      "This is crazy.\n",
      "Forget about all that.\n",
      "That was a whole life-changing car accident ago.\n",
      "I love you.\n",
      "I don't want to break up.\n",
      "But you did.\n",
      "You did want to.\n",
      "And if you had those feelings once, then you're going to have those feelings again, and you're going to keep on having them.\n",
      "And I can't count on that car to hit you every time you do.\n",
      "What are you saying?\n",
      "I'm saying... you wanted your breakup, you got it.\n",
      "What?! Stella, wait!\n",
      "No, you know what, Ted?\n",
      "???\n",
      "So you broke up with her and she didn't know it?\n",
      "Apparently.\n",
      "And you actually said, \"I want to break up\"?\n",
      "No, of course not.\n",
      "Who says \"I want to break up\"?\n",
      "That's a horrible thing to say.\n",
      "Well, that's true.\n",
      "Hello?\n",
      "Hi, Ted Mosby? We have you listed as the emergency contact for Barney Stinson.\n",
      "What is it?\n",
      "What it was was this.\n",
      "I made it. I made it!\n",
      "Dude, I...\n",
      "I can't believe you ran all the way up here.\n",
      "Jeez. Flatter yourself much?\n",
      "What an ego on this guy.\n",
      "Um, I was up in this part of town because I had to attend a very important international business meeting.\n",
      "If you're here to come crawling back, just save it.\n",
      "I'm doing awesome without you.\n",
      "Even br now, 'cause I can play the sympathy card with the females.\n",
      "And BTW, there's one bone downstairs that ain't broken.\n",
      "Marshall, you know what I'm talking about.\n",
      "Up top!\n",
      "Hup!\n",
      "Are you sure?\n",
      "Yeah, dude. Why do y think I had them set it this way?\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Ow!\n",
      "Worth it.\n",
      "Barney, you, uh...\n",
      "Yocould've died.\n",
      "Ted, I'm sorry I broke the bro code.\n",
      "No, I'm-I'm sorry.\n",
      "Ted, can we be friends again?\n",
      "Barney, come on, we're... we're more than friends.\n",
      "We're brothers.\n",
      "You're my brother, Ted. You're my brother, Barney.\n",
      "Did you hear that, Marshall?\n",
      "We're brothers now.\n",
      "Marshall's my brother, too.\n",
      "We're all brothers.\n",
      "Yeah, but I'm your best brother, right?\n",
      "And that's how your Uncle Barney and I buried the hatchet.\n",
      "It got pretty mushy and embarrassing after that.\n",
      "Let's skip ahead.\n",
      "I had to look away because if I watched what the paramedics were about to do, I would have passed out.\n",
      "Then they took out this electric blade thing and I kept thinking, \"This isn't happening. This isn't happening. \"\n",
      "Oh, my God. What did they cut?\n",
      "My suit.\n",
      "My beautiful suit.\n",
      "But you're alive, and, and Ted's alive.\n",
      "This is amazing!\n",
      "Two miracles in one day.\n",
      "What is the matter with you?\n",
      "How can you possibly be this cynical?!\n",
      "You want to know? Yeah.\n",
      "You really want to know? Yeah!\n",
      "Fine.\n",
      "When I was a kid, I had this dog, Sir Scratchawan.\n",
      "Anyway, Sir Scratchawan got really old, so my parents decided to put him down.\n",
      "It was the toughest day of my young life.\n",
      "Good-byI love you.\n",
      "And when they took him to the vet, he told them that earlier that very day, he had learned about an experimental procedure called a canine/testudine cerebro-xenograft.\n",
      "Ever heard of it?\n",
      "No.\n",
      "Well, it saved Sir Scratchawan's life.\n",
      "He lived another seven years.\n",
      "Miracle. Except for one... kind of big side effect from the surgery.\n",
      "SiScratchawan!\n",
      "Welcome home!\n",
      "He turned into a turtle.\n",
      "I know. It's weird, right?\n",
      "Apparently, a very common complication from canine/testudine cerebro-xenografts.\n",
      "And he didn't seem to remember any of his old tricks.\n",
      "Go get it, Scratchy.\n",
      "Go get it!\n",
      "Go get it! Get it!\n",
      "Go get it, Scratchy.\n",
      "Go get it.\n",
      "How long was it before...?\n",
      "Longer than I'm proud of, Lily.\n",
      "Longer than I'm proud of.\n",
      "And that's when I realized miracles ain't real.\n",
      "Excuse me.\n",
      "Mosby, you're still here?\n",
      "Your tests came back, like, an hour ago. You're fine.\n",
      "Are you kidding me? Why didn't you tell me?!\n",
      "I'm sorry.\n",
      "I guess it was rude of me to keep resuscitating that guy with a rake sticking out of his chest.\n",
      "Um, I have to go right now. Barney, I...\n",
      "Go.\n",
      "Run, Ted. Run.\n",
      "If there's anything I've taught you over the years, it's...\n",
      "Barney, he left. Oh.\n",
      "Hey, Ted said that right before the accident, his life flashed before his eyes.\n",
      "You know, all the stuff he loves.\n",
      "Did that happen to you? Oh, yeah.\n",
      "I know what he saw: boobs. Scotch.\n",
      "And money.\n",
      "Suits. A suit of money.\n",
      "A suit of boobs.\n",
      "A giant boob wearing a suit of money.\n",
      "And the boob is lactating scotch.\n",
      "I guess that's pretty much everything you love, right?\n",
      "Yeah, pretty much.\n",
      "Kids, a lot of weird, random things have happened in my life,\n",
      "but that car accident is one of the few I'd call a miracle, not because of what happened, but because of what happened next.[/i]\n",
      "Hi.\n",
      "Hi.\n",
      "Can I talk to you?\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "I got you this orange kangaroo.\n",
      "Uh... thanks.\n",
      "So I've been thinking about what changed from the moment I broke up with you to the moment I knew I wanted you back.\n",
      "And, um, I think I finally figured out what happened.\n",
      "Your cab got T-boned by a jackass on a cell phone?\n",
      "No. I changed.\n",
      "I'm ready to give you what you need.\n",
      "That's why I spent ten minutes on the damn claw machine trying to get the big, fake diamond ring.\n",
      "But all I could get was this orange kangaroo.\n",
      "Diamond ring?\n",
      "Ted(2030): Kids, there is something I wish my dad told me. The longest pause you will ever experience in your life is the one that follows asking the question...\n",
      "Ted is in a playroom with Stella...\n",
      "Ted: Will you marry me?\n",
      "Ted(2030): Your brain goes into overdrive, imaging every possible response.\n",

      "Stella: Oh, God, no.\n",
      "Stella: You want me to marry..(laughing).No.\n",

      "Ted: It's Ted!\n",
      "Ted (2030): But if you're lucky, she may answer with the single greatest word in the English language.\n",
      "Stella: Yes.\n",
      "CREDITS\n",
      "Ted (2030): Stella and I spent that summer happily engaged. Marshall was still coping with unemployment.\n",
      "Marshall to lily: What are you doing?\n",
      "Ted(2030): Lily threw herself into her painting.\n",
      "Marshall to Barney: What are you doing?\n",
      "Ted(2030): Barney was rehabilitating from his bus accident.\n",
      "Marshall to himself: What are you doing?\n",
      "Ted(2030): And well, Marshall just kept coping with unemployment.\n",
      "Marshall to Robin: What are you doing?\n",
      "Ted(2030): And Robin continued to uphold the high journalistic standards of Metro News 1.\n",
      "Robin: Is your favorite brand of dental floss poisoning your entire family? Tune in at 11:00 for the shocking... Tooth.\n",
      "At the bar...\n",
      "Robin: Okay, I officially hate my job. I'm not a reporter, I'm just someone who shows up at night and scares people. I'm the bogeyman with a teleprompter.\n",
      "Barney: \"Bogeyman with a teleprompter.\" That's hilarious! Great joke, Robin, great joke.\n",
      "Lily: Barney, no offense to Robin, but that wasn't that funny.\n",
      "Barney: Are you kidding? That was a great joke. It's smart, funny, beautiful, the whole package. It's everything you're afraid to let yourself want. In a joke. \"Bogeyman with a teleprompter.\" Classic.\n",
      "Lily is at Barney's apartment...\n",
      "Lily: Okay, what is so urgent that you called me and begged me to come over at 7:22 in the morning?\n",
      "Barney: I could tell you knew something was up with me, and you're right. But I can't tell you what it is. I should tell you, but I can't! I have to. I never will! I'm going to. Let's just drop it. What's up with you?\n",
      "Lily: Barney, just say it.\n",
      "Barney: I think I'm in love with Robin.\n",

      "Ted: Don't know that either.\n",
      "Marshall: Well, does she have any hobbies?\n",
      "Ted: Yes. She's exactly the kind of person who would have hobbies. And interests, too. I am one lucky son of a bitch.\n",
      "Marshall: Dude, you don't know anything about the woman you're marrying.\n",
      "Ted: What? You're crazy! I know plenty.\n",
      "Marshall: What color are her eyes?\n",
      "Ted: The color of the ocean after a storm.\n",
      "Marshall: Which is?\n",
      "Ted: Beautiful.\n",
      "At Barney's apartment...\n",
      "Lily: I don't believe it. I thought you called me over here to uncuff you from your s*x swing again, but you're in love? That is so sweet!\n",
      "Barney: It's not \"sweet.\" It's like a disease. I slept with Robin one time and I caught feelings. I caught feelings bad. I used protection and everything.\n",
      "Lily: Barney, you don't \"catch\" feelings, you just have them. And they're good.\n",
      "Barney: They're terrible! I can't eat, I can't sleep. She's all I think about. I close my eyes, I see Robin. I, I hear a song; it reminds me of Robin.\n",
      "Girl: Morning.\n",
      "Barney: I sleep with that chick, I'm thinking about Robin.\n",
      "At the apartment...\n",
      "Ted: Okay, so I don't know every single detail about Stella. What's really about? Do you not like her or something?\n",
      "Marshall: No, Ted, I like Stella a lot. She's a Mets fan.\n",
      "Ted: Really?\n",
      "Marshall: It's just that everything with you has moved so fast. You've only known each other a few months. Don't you think maybe you should slow things down a little bit? Get to know each other better?\n",
      "Ted: I'll have a whole life time to get to know her better. Right now, I know the one thing that I have to: that I love her.\n",
      "At Barney's apartment...\n",
      "Lily: You love her? Barney, how can you be in love, and still be sleeping with anything that moves?\n",
      "Barney: I'm sorry, I don't follow you. That's like saying, \"How can an ant carry \"20 times its body weight, but root beer floats are still delicious?\" Are the two even related? Really?\n",
      "Lily: Barney, you're going to have to stop screwing around if you want to be Robin's boyfriend.\n",
      "Barney: \"Boyfriend\"? I don't want to be Robin's boyfriend.\n",
      "Lily: Well, what do you want, then?\n",
      "Barney: I don't know. I just want to be with her. All the time. I want to hear about her day and tell her about mine. I want to hold her hand and smell her hair. But I don't want to be her stupid boyfriend.\n",
      "Lily: Barney, what you just described is a relationship between a boyfriend and a girlfriend. And a pretty clingy one at that.\n",
      "Barney: Look, Lily, are you going to help me out with this or not?\n",
      "Lily: I'm a kindergarten teacher. I see a confused, little kid in the corner trying to eat the lefty scissors, I gotta help the poor, little b*st*rd. But only if you stop sleeping around. Deal?\n",
      "Barney: Deal.\n",
      "At Metro News One...\n",
      "Robin: Coming up next, is your local ice cream man actually driving a roving meth lab on wheels? Stay tuned for the full... Scoop. Really?\n",
      "At the apartment, Ted and Stella are eating...\n",
      "Stella: I know dudes think it's girlie for a guy to cook, but us ladies? We find it mighty sexy.\n",
      "Ted: Really? You know... My grandma taught me how.\n",
      "Stella: Oh, yeah, she did.\n",
      "Ted: Yeah. I had a lot of time after school to watch her cook because I wasn't good at sports.\n",
      "Stella: I'm on fire right now. Delicious. What's in this pesto?\n",
      "Ted: Oh, you know, the usual: basil, garlic, olive oil, but can you guess my secret ingredient?\n",
      "Stella: Peanuts.\n",
      "Ted: Yes. How did you know that?\n",
      "Stella falls of her stair... A few moments later...\n",
      "Ted: OK, let me think, what else?\n",
      "Stella: You know what, sweetie? I woke up so early and I had a really long day at work. And there was that whole thing where you tried to kill me. Can we please just go to sleep?\n",
      "Ted: No, I clearly need to know more about you. Let's do firsts. First kiss?\n",
      "Stella: Dale Harris, second grade. You're talking like peck on the cheek or a full-on passionate making out?\n",
      "Ted. Passionate making out.\n",

      "Barney (on the phone): Hi, Robin..(he jabbers something and hang up) She wasn't there. I left a voice mail.\n",
      "Lily: You left a voice, but it wasn't male. Barney, I don't get it. You've called a million girls a million times.\n",
      "Barney: Yeah, but those were just booty calls.\n",
      "Flashback.\n",
      "21h03. Barney's at the bar and calls someone...\n",
      "Barney (present): On a booty call, you barely even have to talk. Around 9:00 p.m., you say...\n",
      "Barney: Hey, baby, it's Barney. You busy tonight? Sweet. See you in half an hour? Can't wait.\n",
      "Barney (present): But the later it gets, the fewer words you need.\n",
      "Barney (on the phone) Barney. Busy? Sweet.\n",

      "Robin: You called, said..., and hung up. What do you want?\n",
      "Barney (to lily): Help me!\n",

      "Lily: Just ask her out.\n",
      "Barney: Robin, I was wondering if... Nothing. Gotta go. Bye. That was just a practical joke. I'm not really in love with Robin. You should've seen the look on your face. There's cameras right there and there and there. What a legendary prank that we're never going to speak of again.\n",
      "Lily looks and sees that there really is a camera...\n",

      "Marshall: She's never seen Star Wars?! Ted, the only people in the universe who haven't seen Star Wars are the characters, and that's 'cause they lived them. That's 'cause they lived theStar Wars.\n",
      "Ted: You've got to calm down.\n",
      "Marshall: I told you. You didn't know this girl well enough. What if... you show it to her, she doesn't like it?\n",
      "Ted: Dude, it's just a movie.\n",
      "Marshall: Star Wars is your all-time favorite movie, and whether or not Stella likes it is actually important. It's like, it's a test of how compatible you guys are.\n",

      "Lily: I lied. They're not coming and I'm about to leave.\n",
      "Barney: Why?\n",
      "Lily: Because... they're not in love with Robin, and neither am I. I mean, she's great and sweet. I'm not going to pretend that I haven't noticed her body, but this is off topic. Good luck.\n",
      "Barney: Wait, wait, I can't do this. She'll never take me seriously. She thinks I'm some womanizing idiot.\n",
      "Lily: We both know you're more than that. Show Robin the Barney I met the other day.\n",
      "Barney: You mean the insecure, touchy-feely she-male who sounded alarmingly close to Ted?\n",
      "Lily: Ted hit that for over a year.\n",
      "Barney: Wish me luck.\n",
      "Barney goes to the table where Robin is. At Ted's apartment...\n",
      "Ted: I just thought it'd be fun to watch a movie tonight, and since you've never seen Star Wars, I figured why not? No big deal. It's pretty good.\n",
      "Stella: Sounds like a plan. I'm gonna grab a beer. You want one?\n",
      "Ted: The movie's already started, so...\n",
      "Stella: It's some words flying through space. I'm not going to read that anyway.\n",

      "Marshall: Off to a bad start.\n",
      "Ted: What are you doing down there?\n",
      "Marshall: I'm making sure my best friend is marrying the right woman. That's what I'm doing.\n",

      "At the restaurant...\n",
      "Barney: So, Robin... tell me about your day, and not just what happened, how you felt about what happened.\n",
      "Robin: What?\n",

      "Robin: Why are you acting like this?\n",
      "Barney: Like what?\n",
      "Robin: You're being super nice. It's... freaking me out. Be... gross, be inappropriate. Be Barney.\n",
      "Barney: I'm being Barney, and I think tonight's going to be de... wait for it... lightful. Delightful.\n",
      "Robin: Right. So I went to the chiropractor yesterday. That guy bent me over the table and pounded me for a good hour.\n",
      "Barney: Is insurance going to cover that? Sometimes they don't.\n",
      "Robin: That's it? Today I was at the dentist. That guy drilled me all day long. He drilled me hard. He filled all of my cavities. Come on, man.\n",
      "Barney: Your teeth look fantastic.\n",

      "Ted: You look really beautiful tonight.\n",
      "Stella: You don't look so bad yourself, mister. She kisses him on the neck\n",
      "Ted: Great scene, great scene. Star Wars fun fact number seven... George Lucas based the film's structure on Akira Kurosawa's The Hidden Fortress. He also owes a debt to Campbell's work with comparative mythology.\n",
      "Stella: Yeah, Ted, I'm losing wood over here. What's going on?\n",
      "Ted: Nothing.\n",
      "Stella: Wait, it's really important to you that I like this movie, isn't it? I'm not gonna like it with you staring at me the whole time. Go to your room and I will come get you when it's over. Go.\n",
      "Ted goes to his room. Marshall stands up from behind the couch which scares Stella and makes her drop the popcorn.\n",
      "Marshall: Should I leave, too?\n",
      "Ted: What part, what part?\n",
      "At the restaurant, the waitress leans over to pour the wine and shows her cleavage to Barney, but he leans over and looks at Robin.\n",
      "Barney: Thanks.\n",
      "Robin: Nothing? Not even a glance? Even I was thinking about rocking a motorboat on those bad boys. What the hell is wrong with you?\n",
      "Barney: I don't always want to be that guy. Sometimes I want to be someone you can have an actual conversation with. Now, tell me something about you that I don't know yet. Seriously.\n",
      "Robin: There's a job opening at a new cable network that would be perfect for me... completely legit world news, interviews with people who matter... but I decided I'm not going to apply.\n",
      "Barney: Why not?\n",
      "Robin: Because I'm a joke. I'm just the scary news lady from some stupid local news channel.\n",
      "Barney: We both know you're more than that. Promise me you'll apply.\n",
      "Robin: It's not as easy...\n",
      "Barney: Promise me you'll apply.\n",
      "Robin: I promise.\n",

      "Ted: Great scene.\n",
      "Marshall: Great scene! Okay, we should have just heard... but Stella didn't make a peep.\n",
      "Ted: I'm gonna take a look. She's not even watching. She's texting.\n",
      "Marshall: I'll tell her you still want to be friends.\n",
      "Ted: I don't believe this. I believe, she knows this is important to me. She's blatantly...(Ted looks at his phone) \"Stop watching me, jackasses.\"\n",
      "At the restaurant.\n",
      "Barney: To taking chances.\n",
      "Robin: To taking chances.\n",
      "Barney: You know, Robin, there's actually something, I do want to talk to you about.\n",
      "Barman: Last call.\n",
      "Barney: Of course it is. One more for the road?\n",
      "Robin: Yeah, why not? Hold that thought?\n",
      "Barney ; I will.\n",
      "Ted and Marshall are in the room. Stella comes in.\n",
      "Stella: I loved it.\n",
      "Ted: Yes! I am marrying a woman who is not only hot but loves Star Wars. That's the dream.\n",
      "Stella: What was that?\n",
      "Ted: I was high-fiving 15-Year-Old Me through the space-time continuum. We did it. We did it, you masturbating little b*st*rd. Champagne for everybody. Ted leaves the room.\n",
      "Stella: It was so good.\n",
      "Marshall: You hated it, didn't you?\n",
      "Stella: It's so stupid. First of all, how do they understand that walking bear they hang around with all the time?\n",
      "Marshall: Wookiee.\n",
      "Stella: He goes nin nin nin... They're all like, \"That's a good point, Bear, \"let's try that.\"\n",
      "Marshall: He's a Wookiee, and his kind is actually more intelligent than they appear. That is Ted's favorite movie of all time. He watches it when he's home sick with the flu. He watches it on rainy Sunday afternoons in the fall. He watches it on Christmas Eve. Ted watches Star Wars in sickness and in health, in good times and in bad. Do you really think that you can pretend to like a movie that you actually hate for the rest of your life?\n",
      "Stella: I do.\n",
      "Marshall: Then, Ted's a lucky guy. Bear.\n",
      "At the restaurant. Robin comes back and Barney has two glasses.\n",
      "Barney: So, here's the deal.\n",
      "Robin: April, have... you met Barney? April just finished her shift, she's looking to blow off some steam.\n",
      "Barney: Would you excuse us for one sec? What are you doing?\n",
      "Robin: You were so nice to me tonight, I wanted to return the favor, wingwoman-style. So, as I was saying, Barney is the Yankees' new second-baseman. And Barney, April asked if tomorrow, you could hit a goal for her during the baseball match. You can't make this stuff up. So, you two kids have fun.\n",
      "April: So are you... nervous about the game?\n",
      "Barney: Yeah, I'm nervous for the other team 'cause when I step up to that plate... I am not a New York Yankee. Any other night, I would probably try to convince you that I am, but I'm not. I'm just some guy who's in love with the girl that just left, and she's never going to feel the same way. So I'm just going to go.\n",
      "Lily's at Barney's apartment.\n",
      "Barney: And that was it.\n",
      "Lily: I'm so sorry, Barney. You can't give up. You know, it may take some time, but once Robin sees the new you...\n",
      "April: When my family gets to Yankee Stadium, are the tickets under your name or mine?\n",
      "Barney: My name, and tell your nephews to bring their mitts. They're going to be in foul ball country. Come on. The Robin stuff was completely true.\n",
      "Lily: Damn it, Barney. I mean, for the last time, you can't... you can't be in love with Robin and still be sleeping with every bimbo on the planet. You have to choose right now.\n",
      "Barney: I choose bimbos.\n",
      "Lily: What?\n",
      "Barney: Bimbos make me happy. Bimbos make me feel alive. Bimbos make me want to pretend to be a better man. This whole thing with Robin was just a fling, but at the end of the day, my heart belongs to bimbos.\n",
      "Lily: This is just a defense mechanism, because you're afraid of getting hurt. You're just confused.\n",
      "Barney: Oh, I'm not confused. You know who is confused? Bimbos. They're easily confused. It's one of the thousand little things I love about them. I love their vacant, trusting stares, their sluggish, unencumbered minds, their unresolved daddy issues. I love them and they love me. Bimbos have always been there for me, through thick and thin. Mostly thin. B- man don't do thick crust. What up?\n",
      "Lily: See you, Barney.\n",
      "Ted from 2030: When I first moved to New York, it was dingy, disgusting, ugly, flea-ridden, stinky and altogether terrifying, but then, sadly. The whole city started to go uphill. The streets got a little cleaner, the rents got a little higher, and one by one, the crappy old places we loved began to disappear. The Elbow Room, an old punk rock club, became a drugstore. McHale's, a working-class watering hole, became a fast-food place. And Fez, a Moroccan-themed lounge, became a bank. And not just any bank.\n",
      "At Ted and Marshall's apartment\n",

      "Ted: Okay, first of all, you look like the last pick in the draft. And, second, why are you so excited about some bank?\n",
      "Barney: Our company just bought them out in a ruthless takeover. Took two months. Cost 2,000 jobs. It was brutal. Who wants a T-shirt? (He throws one to Ted.) Hey, Marshall, they're hiring in the legal department. I could get you a job.\n",
      "Lily: Barney, Marshall didn't quit his last soul-sucking corporate job just to go work at a bank. He's gonna be an environmental lawyer.\n",
      "Ted from 2030: That was the plan, anyway. (We can see Marshall in front of the mirror of the bathroom.) Over the next few weeks, Marshall went on a lot of interviews.\n",
      "Marshall (to the mirror): You are confident, you are energetic, you are focused!\n",
      "Ted from 2030: A lot of interviews.\n",
      "Marshall(to the mirror): You are flexible on salary, you're willing to compromise, you're not gonna cry this time.\n",
      "Ted from 2030: Too many interviews.\n",
      "Marshall(to the mirror): You are sad, you are beaten down, you will get through this, come home, get in your big underpants and take a nap.\n",

      "Wendy: Oh, we just got a new cook. You have to try the burger, it's amazing.\n",

      "Wendy (taking note): Five burgers.\n",
      "Ted: Really? You want to eat here?\n",

      "Wendy: Five burgers.\n",

      "Barney: Italian.\n",
      "Ted: I had Italian for lunch.\n",
      "Wendy: I can come back.\n",
      "Robin: No. We always do this. We spend an hour arguing about where to eat, and we end up here anyway. I haven't eaten for two days. Can we please, for the love of God, just order something now?\n",
      "Ted: Chinese?\n",
      "Robin: Oh.\n",
      "Barney: I don't like Chinese.\n",
      "Ted: Indian?\n",

      "Lily: My God. This burger is so good. It's like Christmas in my mouth, meat Christmas.\n",
      "Ted: It's like an angel from heaven landed in the kitchen at MacLaren's. Where the chef killed it and ran it through the meat grinder.\n",

      "Marshall: It's okay.\n",

      "Marshall: Why would I have to leave? I can have anything I want delivered, and New York City cable is awesome. Have you seen this public access show with the old Jewish lady in a bikini? (Laughing) It's disgusting.\n",
      "Ted: Marshall, you have to get over this paranoia. You are not gonna get mugged.\n",
      "Marshall: What if I do, Ted. I don't have a switchblade. I don't know how to break-dance and win the begrudging respect of a street gang.\n",
      "Ted: That's it, you're taking a walk. Come on, go.\n",
      "Marshall: No. Look, the old lady in a bikini is back on. I'm just gonna lie back and get comfortable.\n",

      "Everybody: What?\n",
      "Marshall: It's not it.\n",

      "Robin: I mean, it is just a burger.\n",
      "Marshall: Just a burger? It's so much more than just a burger. I mean, that first bite... Oh, what heaven that first bite is. The bun, like a sesame-freckled breast of an angel, resting gently on the ketchup and mustard below. Flavors mingling in a seductive \"pas de deux\". And then... a pickle the most... playful... little pickle, and then a slice of tomato, a leaf of lettuce, and a... a patty... of ground beef, so... exquisite...swirling in your mouth, breaking apart and combining again in a fugue of sweets and savories so... delightful. This is no mere sandwich of grilled meat and toasted bread. This is God... speaking to us through food.\n",
      "Lily: And you got our wedding vows off the Internet.\n",
      "Marshall: Okay, look, so, so this, this isn't the place. All right, it's no big deal. It's another place with a green door and a red neon sign that says \"Burger\". I'll just... I'll call every restaurant in Manhattan and ask 'em what colour their door is. No big deal, right? Let's do this.\n",
      "He leaves the restaurant.\n",

      "Lily: It was funny at first, but then it became a daily thing. I thought, \"Okay, well, at least he's not leaving the house like that.\" Then, one day, he opened the door to get the paper. Day after that, went downstairs to get the mail.\n",
      "Ted: Everyone's got an underpants radius. For most of us, it's the distance from the bedroom to the bathroom, but as your self-esteem gets smaller, your underpants radius gets bigger.\n",

      "Robin: Finally.\n",
      "Lily: Excuse me. Did you guys change cooks or something? Because my husband was here 5 years ago, he's sure he had a different burger. Robin is trying to take the plate.\n",
      "Waitress: Yeah, we get this a lot. This place is modelled after this other place uptown with the same green door and \"Burger\" sign.\n",

      "Marshall: Goliath National Bank. That's why Barney's been going on and on about how, how great Goliath is. He wanted you to be excited for me since we will to working together.\n",
      "Barney: Well, technically not together. You won't have access to my floor.\n",
      "Lily: But you want to be an environmental lawyer.\n",
      "Marshall: Yeah and I also want to be a Harlem Globetrotter and get paid in candy, but in the meantime, I need a job, and this is, this is a really good one. It's great pay and there's good benefits, and to be honest, it gives me a reason to put on pants in the morning. You know, I have my whole life to save the planet, but right now I'm kind of really excited to wear pants again.\n",

      "Marshall: It's stupid. I think about that first week in New York. You know? I was 22 years old. I had my whole future ahead of me. I guess I just kind of thought that if I could have that burger one more time and feel that way for one more night, that I might be able to check that off the list, and grow up, go work for the stupid bank, and just... be happy.\n",
      "Man: You know, that burger place isn't gone. It just moved to a new location. And I can tell you where that is for a hundred bucks.\n",

      "He begins to crunch his burger slowly.\n",
      "Marshall: This is it.\n",

      "Robin: Oh, my God. I just want you inside of me.\n",

      "Lily: Yeah, probably.\n",
      "Ted: That's great! We have darts. A half ping-pong. An aquarium. Look how it's getting a great night as planned. One could make the bait and watch them fight.\n",
      "Barney: No thank you. I play not with aquariums unless they are my two favorite animals: the pilot fish and torturlute. Did you see!\n",
      "Ted: For torturlute? You're right.\n",

      "Barney: Air Hockey. Well done my fat.\n",

      "Barney: If you call now, you'll regret it. I slept with me full of women who were then sent to graze and then decamped. And sometimes they take the phone and they call me and do it again. And when we finished, I see that look on their faces, that look that says they hate themselves and they would never have known. But if you could see this look...

I just watched. Finally, it is an old lady who made the break dance.And it is good. I will give him a dollar, the next time. Let's pretend I said it: These travel lift were asleep the moment of my week, and I would like to see you Friday night. In a lift. At the restaurant, nice. What do you think?\n",

      "Ted: Yes, I forgot. She is sexy fights.\n",
      "Robin: No, it's true! I love it! I have a culture of hockey. If a guy is a fighter, it is rather sexy. And scars, seriously! If a guy has one, it has a Robin. And if he lost a tooth, I lose my panties.\n",
